Facciotti's relationship with the Collegio Romano may have been complicated by his quarrel with a bookseller who held a privilege for a version of Alvares published in 1596, a controversy that ended up in court in 1597. See Massimo Ceresa, Una stamperia nella Roma del primo Seicento, Rome, Bulzoni, 2000, p. 19.
