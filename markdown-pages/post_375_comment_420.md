"They were moral acts...": At what point might we see that "puzzling something out" gains a high degree of social status, especially in terms of morals? Business-folk, in one line of rhetoric, are seen, for example, today as being de facto morally superior, one could argue (as George Lakoff has), because they have figured out some special problems that others simply haven't. It seems clearly implied, at least, that the mere publishing of such texts containing moral lessons and then spurring on the "puzzling out" of such and maybe other lessons for the readership would be in itself a very moral act. Did technical problem solving ever see its day in those earlier centuries as a moral venture?
