An important new contribution to the evidence available is Annemarieke Willemsen, Back to the Schoolyard, Brepols, 2008, which presents a broad range of physical evidence (archaeological to artistic) for the architecture, implements, and practice of medieval and early Renaissance classrooms. It is lavishly illustrated.
