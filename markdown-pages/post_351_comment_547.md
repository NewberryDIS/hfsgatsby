This is a good suggestion, Mr. Brannon. Usually the Sessa cat appears with its victimized mouse, but not always. There are some good bibliographies on the Sessa firm, but not, as far as I know, a systematic study of the woodcut material they used. Since it was a long-lived and important publishing house, that would make for an interesting study.
