With regard to the identification of the Cato of the Disticha Catonis, we are told in the tradition of the Accessus ad auctores that, "œDuo Catones erant Romae, Censorinus Cato et Uticensis Cato," that is, Marcus Porcius Cato (the Elder), whom you cite, and Marcus Porcius Cato "œUticensis" (the Younger) (d. 46 BCE). Perhaps you should mention both and possible conflations? The attributions may be incorrect, but the fact that most people believed in the authorship is important when it comes to studying the reception of the text in the Middle Ages and beyond.
