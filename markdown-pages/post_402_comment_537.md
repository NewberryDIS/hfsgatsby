A curious document of the market for the grammar of Manuel Ãlvares is explicated by Rolf Kemmler (art. cit. above at section 5.00). An autograph of Ãlvares assigns the rights to publish his grammar in Spain to the Jesuit order in that country. It is unclear why the order would need such an explicit grant.
