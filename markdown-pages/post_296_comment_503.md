I like this idea of a 'school system' as an analogy for what the Jesuits were doing. They certainly set out in the Ratio Studiorum to create a system --one could correctly translate 'ratio' as 'system.' The source documents about the creation of the Ratio have all been published, and they make for fascinating reading. I think the reports of the various committees, quickly summarized in the next paragraph, evidence a process that was for the period genuinely open. Above all the teachers seemed to feel that they needed some freedom to use whatever texts they had, adapting them as necessary to the particular needs of their students locally.
