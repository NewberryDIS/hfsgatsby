In saying that I have not seen annotated copies, I was thinking of the kind of annotations that students make in textbooks. However, a number of surviving copies of Alciati were used as autograph albums (the period term for such a book is <em>album amicorum</em>) by university students, meaning that during their studies and travels, they would solicit inscriptions from friends. Most often these are entered into special copies of the emblem book bound with extra leaves intended for the additions.
