This modeling of emblems on printer's marks seems like a fascinating media-historical phenomenon- new medial practices/conventions leading directly to new literary/pictorial forms, and referencing the actual technological practices that make these forms possible at that! I wonder the extent to which similar innovations might have resulted from conventions of manuscript production in earlier centuries or in later developments in the history of print and other media (contests for animated web-content based around the Google name)?
