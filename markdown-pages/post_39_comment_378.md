Copyright as we know it, to protect the author, is really an 18th-century development. Before that there were various kinds of registrations and privileges that protected the publishers, who were assumed to have made an investment worth protecting commercially. A good intro to the whole issue is Elizabeth Armstrong's book, Before Copyright (Cambridge U. Press, 1990).
