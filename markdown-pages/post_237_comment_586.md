You raise several points here, Alissa, all of which point to the last part of your comment, the matter of competitiveness. This was certainly not new to humanist learning; indeed, one of the things the early humanists most disliked about medieval scholasticism was the pettiness of the arguments back and forth. The humanist ideal was one of rhetorical truth achieved by argument, to be sure, but typically within a context of collaboration. Mancinelli's many scholarly commentaries were largely aimed at making the base text available to the broad public that printing made possible. 




I'd have to think a little more about the ideal of diversity. Certainly what we mean by that would not fit the situation in Renaissance Italy. Mancinelli's moving around from city to city probably had more to do with careerism than a love of being in different places.
