You are certainly right to point to the fact that this is a continuing issue, both in print and in the new media environment. Every time we encounter something without a trademark or brand name we recognize, we have to evaluate it for ourselves. The task is even trickier online, where branding is particularly weak and where content creators do not always cite their sources.
