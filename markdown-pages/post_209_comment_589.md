Does "largely an autobiography" here refers to the fact that his own teaching techniques are the ones he shares with his peers? In other words, is it his personal experience that gives him clues about "teaching with print?" Also, by the moment he started considering sharing with others how to use print while teaching, can you please elaborate further if it was common for someone like Mancinelli to take into consideration what general opinion thought about print? I will probably find the answers to my questions later in the chapter, but I wanted to ask it just in case. Thanks
