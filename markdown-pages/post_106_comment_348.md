You guessed it! The orb surmounted by a single or double cross is a commonplace mark in Italian presses of the first century and it often bears the initials of the printer or publisher. Olschki imitated the style and since they have the same initials as Soardi, the resemblance is striking. I don't remember exactly what the O stands in Soardi's mark, but you can look it up in G. Zappella's guide to Italian printer's marks, published in 1986 --but not by Olschki.
