I understand what you mean by, "the scribe is no longer to be compared to a barber or a musician," but "musician" may not be the best word to use. A distinction between "minstrels" and "musicians" was coming into being in this period, and depending on the context and the language in which the term appears, the latter group could include renowned composers of polyphony.
