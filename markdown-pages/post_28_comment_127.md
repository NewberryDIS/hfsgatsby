A good argument could be made, I think, that the mores taught elementary &amp; intermediate education, although often a matter of morality (in the modern sense), was as much or even more a matter of manners (&gt; motto attributed to William of Wyckham (d1404): "œManners maketh man."), and was not so much an education in moral decision making (an expression suggestive of casuistry), as an education in proper behavior. This education in proper behavior had, to be sure, a moral component, but it was very much concerned with correct behaviors and the astute management of social, political, and business relationships.
