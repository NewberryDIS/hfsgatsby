I am interested in your statement "One thing humanists all over Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth century shared was a pugnacious willingness to argue that derived from scholastic models. Petrarch made many innovations in humanist thought, among them introducing a sustained polemic against the scholastics. In so doing he also imported into humanism the quarrelsomeness of the universities, where disputation pro and contra was a permanent fixture." I had not before connected scholastic disputation with the development of humanist dialogues and invective, and you note that the latter was based on classical models. Could you provide more detail about how you see the relationship between scholastic disputation and the development of humanist dialogue and invective?
