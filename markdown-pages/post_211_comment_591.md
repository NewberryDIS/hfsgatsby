Does the end of this paragraph meant that with manuscripts students were more into the repetitive aspect (copy of the originals, imitation) of learning rather than the creative one? Knowing that the print is one of the best revolution that happened during the renaissance, we tend to ignore the fact that before that,some traditional methods and methodologies of knowledge transfers seemed to be efficient and effective. Should we forget the manuscripts and oral ages to only focus on the invention of the printing press? Should the old teaching and learning style absolutely lose their appeal to allow the to shine? I am just wondering because I am particularly interested in the relationship between past and new techniques in sciences since I know that the debate between old and new generation of scientists always exist.
