It is rather surprising for exactly the reason you hint at. Hebrew, although a prestigious form of erudition, was only very rarely studied and it would be very odd indeed to try to learn it from self-help books like the Mercuries (at least that is what they purport to be). In the context of either Latin or Italian studies, the educational orthodoxies of the day suggested that the two languages could be used to improve facility and promote elegance of expression. I strongly suspect that Schoppe is making a show of his own learning in the quadrilingual books, and that the "utility" of the Greek and Hebrew was to the same purpose, to allow readers to stud their compositions with short phrases or proverbial sayings in those languages without really mastering them.
