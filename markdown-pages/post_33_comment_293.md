This image shows one of the internal title pages to the Opera omnia of Mancinelli published at Venice in 1518. Each fascicle contained one or two short works and they could be purchased separately, so a title page like this was an advertisement for the work in this pamphlet. The first paragraph here dedicates the work to a prominent citizen of Mancinelli's home town, and to his son, one of Mancinelli's students. The six-line poem that follows is addressed to the student and tells him what this textbook will help him learn.
