I find your notion of the emblem as a machine for activist kinds of reading really helpful and interesting. I assume that this encouragement of activist interpretive practices is-- to greater and lesser extents, depending on their ideological functions-- at work in other aesthetic forms (signs, paintings, decorative arts, etc) that likewise play on the kind of analogical thinking you describe as characteristic of the period... Is it that emblematics deepen, expand upon a mode of allegorical/analogical hermeneutics, or that the convergence of print, popularization and new pedagogies change the playing field somehow?
