Correction: As EDIT16 (the online bibliography of sixteenth-century Italian imprints) progresses, we now know of three other editions of Cantalicio's textbook printed in Perugia. One of these editions is represented in a single surviving copy and the others have two and four known copies each (that is, known to date, of course). This argues further for a local tradition of a schoolmaster or masters in the 1570s and 80s who adopted this textbook, either for its intrinsic value or because of the tradition that Cantalicio had taught at Perugia. Another locality where the text got editions quite late is Florence. Then too, three of the rare surviving copies of the late Perugian editions survive in libraries at Assisi (which is just a few miles from Perugia), suggesting that there may have been a school there which adopted Cantalicio's textbook some 70 years after his death.
