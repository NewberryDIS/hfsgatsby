People love these marked-up pages for their apparently careless informality, but of course the texts they hold can be read as well. This one has a series of pen trials (where the student practices his own name or that of the book) and several short texts that refer to the passion of Christ. On the left hand page (the back cover of the book), the student has scribbled the mocking phrase "Hail, King of the Jews" (from the gospel of Matthew, chapter 19). On the front cover at the upper right the same student hand has written a prayer that would translate: "Hail, O blood of the living God. May you, who, condemned by the Jews, showed mercy to the thief, have mercy on me, a sinner. Amen."
