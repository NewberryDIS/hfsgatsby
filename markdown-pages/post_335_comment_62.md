The earliest manuscript I know of on learning to write cancellaresca was made around 1465-77 by a monk, Johannes Franciscus Preottonus of Pavia (Library of Congress, Music Division ML171.J6, fols. 129"â€œ130). In it, he gives step-by-step instructions on making minuscule "cazelarescha" (not the 16th-century style). These instructions appear in a collection on music theory, and may have been copied from another source.
