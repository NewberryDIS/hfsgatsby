Alciati imagined the form as a brief poem with motto that assumed a mental picture created in the first instance by the author and re-created for the sake of the puzzle by the reader. All part of the erudite game. Within just a few years, however, publishers got hold of the form and printed pictures, thereafter altering the dynamic. Scholarly authors continued to compose emblems without pictures, but the standard form from the 1530s onward is the one we recognize today, the picture puzzle.
