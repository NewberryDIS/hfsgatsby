The visual cues applied to the texts-the use of red and black and then the transition to full black-might one argue that such a ploy was a marketing device? Could you make the argument that such a maneuver was designed to entice the student to continue, and to aspire to the "grown up" level of their Latin education? Is this conclusion possible, given the focus they had on retaining the student as a customer (the prevalence of texts aimed at long-term students as well as those intended to be distributed in intervals)?
