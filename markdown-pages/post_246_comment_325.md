This condemnation of Erasmus' <em>Cato</em> took place in Lucca in the context of the struggle of the city fathers there to avoid the imposition of a local tribunal of the Roman Inquisition. In addition to the article by Adorni-Braccesi cited in note 6 below, see also her more recent book-length study of Erasmanism, Calvinism, and the Inquisition at Lucca: Simonetta Adorni-Braccesi, <em>Una citta` infetta</em>, Florence: Olschki, 1994, especially pp. 218-219 on this incident.
