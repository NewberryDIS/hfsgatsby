Along with Verini, discussed in this page, another important but little-studied writing master who worked in a popularizing form was Eustachio Celebrino, author of the only book to treat the mercantesca hand systematically. On Celebrino and his circle see: Alessandro Giacomello, "Per una storia del libro di larga diffusione nel Friuli del Cinquecento," in Societa e cultura del Cinquecento nel Friuli occidentale. Studi, Pordenone, 1984, pp. 355-373, esp. 359-362, 366-367.
