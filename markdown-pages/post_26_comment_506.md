I imagine many examples of these texts also remain hidden in private collections or the uncataloged (or non-public) inventories of booksellers. Some records of these books do see the light of day briefly when they are recorded for sale online. Unfortunately, many of the records do not persist on the internet like those of the libraries. I think it would be valuable to collect, store, and share these often fleeting descriptions (as imperfect as some may be) for the use of scholars and collectors alike. Oceans of potentially valuable information on books are appearing and disappearing on the internet every day.
