When this paragraph was written (in 2008), the Donatus diligenter recognitus that Briana probably used in this school was known in a single edition. As of this writing (December 2010), EDIT16 shows four separate editions all known in single copies. By 1570s it was styled et nuperrime auctus and remained in print in the shop of Briani's publishers until after 1590.
