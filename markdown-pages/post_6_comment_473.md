As is discussed in the chapter "œHumanities in Crisis" It is interesting that humanists' own critical intellectual nature led to the demise of their monopoly on learning, do you know of any educators who began as humanists and changed the type of teaching format they used because their critical education made them question some fundamental aspect of humanism? 




In the section on Terrence Calliopious' manuscripts it is discussed that the task of sorting out manuscripts was a lengthy process, and required "œa century or more." Since most of those interests in his manuscripts were educators I wonder who would actually undertake this task? Would it be educators themselves, or would humanists collaborate with monks or another group in order to sort out the manuscripts?
