Interesting. This may be a good example of how writing for the screen needs to be radically different from writing for the page. It is true that the last portion of this chapter once stood elsewhere in the planned monograph and that this is a stitched-in transition, but --as one might expect in a print monograph-- the presence of this section here is anticipated already in sections 4.00 and 4.01. Still, in an electronic book, you cannot easily, and do not expect to be able to, flip quickly back and forth through a chapter to pick up a lost thread. And so the transition may need more prepping here, especially when I have two of my most sophisticated readers telling me the same thing!
