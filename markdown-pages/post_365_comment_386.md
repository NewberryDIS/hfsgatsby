Thanks for this thought, Sean. It has the possibility of contextualizing the emblem in a different way. This could be a good "how many can you name?" challenge for readers. The contemporary example that comes immediately to mind is the East Asian cell phone novel, but I am sure younger and better-wired people than I could think of other electronic examples. An earlier example might be the epistolary novel, but that is more your period of specialty study than mine. My understanding is that the genre resulted from the possibility of print reproducing a series of supposed manuscript documents of a sort and in a way that actual manuscript exchange would not likely have been assembled.
