You got caught in the Chicago rush hour, Mike. When you put in a comment for the very first time, the system puts you on hold until I or another administrator can approve you, i.e. you personally. This is just so we don't get the comment fields filled up by spambots (lots of them in Russia it seems). I was on the bus in heavy downtown traffic when you put in your first note, and just got home. From now on your comments should show up automatically. Let me know if they do not. I will reply to your note about Celenza's book in text --at section 8.02.
