Good question, Ky, in the sense that the existing literature does not address these issues at all well. Wooden printing blocks are very durable and many got re-purposed in later centuries, in general for less and less pretentious kinds of book, eventually finding their way into chapbooks of the most popular sort. Bbut I know of no study that tries to trace this reuse systematically, and my impression is that emblem blocks were not resused this way very often.
