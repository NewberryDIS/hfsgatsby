I find it quite fascinating that textbook markets were generally local and regional in early modern Italy, perhaps because I'm used to thinking of textbooks being standardized and marketed nationally. Are there any examples, though, of a regional market being influenced by an international one, or vice versa? I have the publishing market connections between Venice and London in mind, so I'm curious about the ways, if any, local textbooks markets may have been influenced by international ones for other types of books.
