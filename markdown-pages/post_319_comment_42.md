Same comment I made about the








sudden discussion of geography

text books. Are we prepared for your

discussion of arithmetic, music and 

other "skills"? Vernacular literacy?

Textbooks that teach double-entry

accounting in a book titled

"Selling Humanism" seems

 incongruous. I'm waiting for you to establish the connection between "humanism"

and vernacular school subjects.

(I think the term "humanism" should

be defined in your Introduction to the

book.)

 "How To Do Stuff" I would drop from

the chapter title.
