You quote Tagliente as saying "poor boys" would receive the same opportunities as "rich one[s]." Is this equivocal to what you term "working class men" at the end of the paragraph? I'm not sure I understand the usage of the term "working class" as it applies to Renaissance Italy; does it have the same Marxist connotation as in twentieth-century historiography?
