Since our principal evidence for emblems is the printed books, we don't have a very clear sense of how widely the making of emblems was practiced by amateurs. School emblems (see below, sections 7.11 and 7.15) often had student input, but getting them into print obviously required participation from adults in school and printshop. The one area where we can see lots of amateur emblems is in the surviving manuscripts. There is a good 1997 bibliography of these by Sandra Sider (available on Google Books if your library doesn't have it), but it needs updating already.
