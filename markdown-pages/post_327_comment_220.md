It's not quite common, but not entirely unique to this book either. Most ambitious printers were looking for audiences beyond their own cities, and in the case of school books in Latin even international audiences. There were local and regional markets, however, which are described in summary fashion in section 0.02, and some teachers seem to have published primarily for their own students. One example is described in section 7.10.
