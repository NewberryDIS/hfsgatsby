Not just the good citizen, but the good Christian, or so the exponents of these various disciplines would have claimed. In addition, although a providential origin might be claimed for these skills, they were, in fact, morally neutral, as also was, e.g., rhetoric. Schoolmasters had the dual and sometimes contradictory tasks of equipping their students with the instruments of agression, defense, and manipulation, the tools of power, and of inhibiting or, at least, channeling agression and imbuing the tools they provided with a moral aspect (rather like business colleges teaching "œbusiness ethics").
