This is an interesting question, Lauren: one that has not been written about very much. One place you might look for hints is Kristian Jensen's 1998 article on the fortuna of Aldus's grammar--it is cited in the bibliography at humanismforsale.org. There is also some literature on Venetian publishing for markets in Hungary and the Balkans. Specifically on English customers for Italian books there is some literature too. I will have to look for it and give you furhter cites in a later post.
