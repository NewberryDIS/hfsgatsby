I expand on Aldo as teacher in section 2.05, paragraph 4 below, where I give the specific example of how he used red and black to aid students in comprehension. Your question is a little broader than that, Nancy, in that you ask about type faces. In fact Aldo did commission several types for his press, and it is usually said that the famous Aldine italic (there are examples in section 1.09 below) was invented for the sake of economy and legibility. But none of Aldus's faces was designed specifically for textbooks. The significance of his teaching career really lies in the fact that he could control the entire process --from authorship, through design and printing, to marketing.
