Your thoughts about Humanism For Sale are welcome. The easiest way to communicate them is to use the comment feature on the blog. This allows you to make a note beside any portion of the text that catches your eye, raises a question, or suggests an alternative opinion. As owner of the blog, I review these comments regularly and respond promptly.

Thanks in advance for your feedback,
Paul Gehl
