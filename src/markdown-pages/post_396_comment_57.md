Re.03. The identification of humanism










and the humanist movement in early

modern Europe with elementary

Latin pedagogy in its commercial 

forms trivializes humanism. Yes, there

is always a connection between 

education and its commercial uses

and value. But, again, a distinction

needs to be made between the

philosophy of humanism as a world

view, on the one hand, and one of its

most rudimentary components: 

i.e. the teaching of Latin grammar

and its transmission via little sayings supposely culled from Latin authors.

Yes, elementary Latin grammar was

sold -- and sold successfully -- as 

you have shown. But I find

it confusing and reductive to identify

humanism with the teaching of the

mechanics of one language.
