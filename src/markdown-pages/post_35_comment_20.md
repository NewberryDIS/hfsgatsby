Thanks, David. The present practice is a relict of the paper manuscript, in which you would have easily been able to flip back to the bibliography for the original titles. Right now you need to consult the on-line bibliography at: www.humanismforsale.org/bibliography.pdf

If this proves too cumbersome for many readers, we may have to provide hot links.
