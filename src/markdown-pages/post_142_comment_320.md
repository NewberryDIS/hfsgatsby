"...the Italian Donat was originally a drilling book that went into considerable detail for students coming to the language for the first time." In a practical sense would these students still have been Latin beginners, by the time they started the Italian Donat? Or would they have had some immersion in spoken Latin in the school, during the couple of years of preliminary training mentioned in the first paragraph of Section 2.01?
