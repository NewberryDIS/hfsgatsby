## Humanism for Sale: 
### Making and Marketing Schoolbooks in Italy, 1450-1650 by Paul F. Gehl

Welcome to *Humanism For Sale*, which concerns the ways books were written, designed, printed, and marketed for schools in Renaissance Italy.

This started out to be a scholarly book, but I have decided to publish it as a blog instead. This dynamic form will allow me to present source documents in facsimile, and to revise, correct, and discuss my research with many potential readers. I am thinking of at least three groups:

* [Scholarly specialists](/spc) in printing history and history of education
<li><a href="generalists.html">Generalist readers</a> and <a href="generalists.html">scholars in other fields</a> who want to know more about the Renaissance and the way people were educated then</li>
<li><a href="design_contents.html">Designers</a>, <a href="marketing.html">marketing professionals</a>, <a href="educators.html">educators</a> and others interested in the history of visual communication</li>
</ul>

Or you may wish to go directly to the <a href="quick_summary.html">quick summary</a>, the <a href="abstract.html">abstract</a>, or <a href="/web/20130605190527/http://humanismforsale.org/text/">table of contents</a>.

My reasons for publishing in this form are outlined in a <a href="personal_statement.html">Personal Statement</a>.  My background is summarized in a resume or <a href="/cv">Curriculum Vitae</a>.  Lots of people have helped me with this book and this blog; they are thanked in the <a href="acknowledgements.html">Acknowledgements</a>.

Feedback is welcome in the usual blog format. I invite comments from anyone, but I will necessarily work on the blog only as time permits.
