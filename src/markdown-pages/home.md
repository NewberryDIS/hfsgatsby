## Humanism for Sale: 
### Making and Marketing Schoolbooks in Italy, 1450-1650 by Paul F. Gehl

Welcome to *Humanism For Sale*, which concerns the ways books were written, designed, printed, and marketed for schools in Renaissance Italy.

This started out to be a scholarly book, but I have decided to publish it as a blog instead. This dynamic form will allow me to present source documents in facsimile, and to revise, correct, and discuss my research with many potential readers. I am thinking of at least three groups:

* [Scholarly specialists](/spc) in printing history and history of education
* [Generalist readers](/fg) and [scholars in other fields](/fg) who want to know more about the Renaissance and the way people were educated then
* [Designers](/fd), [marketing professionals](/mp), [educators](/ft) and others interested in the history of visual communication

Or you may wish to go directly to the [quick summary](/qs), the [abstract](/qs), or [table of contents](/text/000).

My reasons for publishing in this form are outlined in a [Personal Statement](/ps).  My background is summarized in a resume or [Curriculum Vitae](/cv).  Lots of people have helped me with this book and this blog; they are thanked in the [Acknowledgements](/ack).

Feedback is welcome in the usual blog format. I invite comments from anyone, but I will necessarily work on the blog only as time permits.
