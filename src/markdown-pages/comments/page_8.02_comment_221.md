Christopher S. Celenza's 2004 work "The Lost Italian Renaissance" urges scholars to study the Latin writings of Renaissance Italians for a fuller understanding of the contested subject. He also stresses the dire need, especially in the United States, for more translations of Latin Renaissance texts. "Humanism for Sale" seems to fit in quite nicely with what Celenza wants, and where he thinks the interdisciplinary field of "Renaissance Studies" should go in the new millenium. How do you, as the scholar, feel about this assessment?
