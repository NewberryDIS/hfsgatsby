Dear Paul,






Is this excellent site still active? I was hoping to use a chapter (the one on emblems) in a MA-level course on Medieval and Baroque Literature this fall, having the students engage with the text and maybe post comments and questions. This would not be until November. Thanks for a very inspiring and informative project!
