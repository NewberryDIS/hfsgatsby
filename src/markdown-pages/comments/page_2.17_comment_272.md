You put your finger on the exact point of my "ad man" metaphor, Jane, and its limitations too. Although advertising strategies are clear in the rhetoric of this and many other Erasmian prefaces, it is not always entirely clear whom he was addressing. Certainly he wrote to and for his own circle of humanist friends, but that was preaching to the choir. Effective advertising must also reach a wider audience of book buyers. In this case we have mostly the success of the edition itself (and its frequent reprinting with this exact same preface) as evidence for the wider audience of the advert.
