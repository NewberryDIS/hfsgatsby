My experience of reading this work is very hypertextual. I find myself bouncing from section to section, revisiting and comparing sections, or even doing searches within the text on phrases I recall or subjects about which I'd like to find more information. Sometimes questions that are raised at one point in the text seem to be answered later. I wonder if some additional intertextual footnotes could be added, creating bridges across the text. While I too was unclear about the use of the term philology here (or was it that I just read the comment and this informed my reading?), this intersection of serious philological concerns and the component parts of basic grammars becomes crystal with the example given in the Erasmus section (2.18, I believe).
