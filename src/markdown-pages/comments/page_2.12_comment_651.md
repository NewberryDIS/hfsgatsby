Since the publication of Humanism For Sale in 2008/2009, I have been revisiting the matter of Cantalicio's grammar, helped along by the fact that digital versions of several early editions have become available in the meantime. It is now clear to me that the earliest editions supervised directly by Cantalicio bear both the title *Summa perutilis...* (on a title or cover page) and *Canones grammatices* (in the caption tile to the preface supplied by Cantalicio). The usage of canones is interesting, since this word is used in the titles of books in many disciplines (law, canon law and medicine most prominently), but I have not found any other writer on grammar who employs this rather elevated term to describe grammatical rules.
