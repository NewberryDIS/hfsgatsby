Thanks for this note, Kev. There is certainly more work to do on "santini" and other pious booklets in the classroom. They straddle the boundary between what is usually thought of as "just" popular reading and instructional materials properly speaking (i.e. without entertainment or private reading value.) As you say, it would require examination of many copies to find those that clearly were used in schools.
