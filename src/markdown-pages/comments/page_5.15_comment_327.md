By "instrumentalizing" here I mean the (relatively modern) notion that language study is primarily an auxiliary or prerequisite to the serious study of other, more substantial disciplines, not a normalizing or moralizing discipline in itself. The Jesuits were pioneers in this view of language study. For a broad view of the history of Latin study, see especially Francois Waquet's *Latin or the Empire of the Sign*.
