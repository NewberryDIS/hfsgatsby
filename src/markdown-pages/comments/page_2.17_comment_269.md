As insufferably elitist as Erasmus could be, did he not have the skills to back it up? Most humanists probably were not quite up to his standard of textual criticism (if I understand Jardine and Rummel correctly). But, as Paul points out, that did put Erasmus in an inherently ironic, and somewhat hilarious, position; selling his skills to those who he might not have considered worthy of them in order to make a living.
