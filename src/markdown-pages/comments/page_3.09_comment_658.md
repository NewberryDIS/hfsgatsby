Farenga, cit. in previous comment, 424-428, contextualizes Mancinelli's Roman period publications among those of other grammarians published by Eucario Silber, then the leading printer in Rome. She also discusses, 435-439, the larger trends in publishing during the 1490s in the Eternal City, which was, more than was true in Venice, adversely affected by the Italian wars. As she notes, Rome never had as international a market as Venice; it was a smaller publishing world altogether.
