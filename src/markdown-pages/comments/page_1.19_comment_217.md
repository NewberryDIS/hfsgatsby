So as I understand this, Grasso and Giraldi were conversing in print in the vernacular Italian, which supposes a broad audience. Yet their subject was a series of works written in Latin, and the appropriateness of those works in the curricula of contemporary schools, which would have had a much narrower audience. At first, this makes little sense, for why would you write to a broader audience that may not care about the issue at hand. But if the focus of Grasso (and Giraldi) was not the content of the argument, but the debate itself, this use of the vernacular discussing Terence is understandable.
