The issue of teachers publishing their own books certainly has resonance today. Some scholars are pilloried (in my view, rightly so) for requiring students to purchase privately published course readers at exorbitant prices. On the other hand, I myself did a primary source reader for Italian Renaissance courses (Blackwell, 2004) because I got so frustrated with finding one that suited my own teaching needs. I have made precious little money off it, but that was not the reason I published it.

"Humanism for Sale" is surely parallel to numerous other self-published (non-text-) books, some of which have had impressive circulation over time. Having just taught it to a class of ten graduate students, I can say that it provoked lively discussion on numerous levels, including of course the contrast between printed texts and online texts. At the risk of belaboring the obvious, I was struck by how easy it was for the students to gain access to this text: whereas several other excellent monographs from the past decade now cost well over $100 and, if not purchased, must be obtained via interlibrary loan, "Humanism for Sale" popped right up on students' computer screens. Perhaps, as "Google Books" becomes more comprehensive (see Tony Grafton's recent essay on the subject, online in the New Yorker, I believe), the contrast in access will be less stark; but for now, surely, it is highly significant. This mode of publication fills a need that I suspect is rapidly increasing.
