I have a guess as to Dr. Zecher's question about the woodcut initial Q. The treatise was printed by Giovanni Battista Sessa, whose devices later in his career typically included a similarly scruffy cat. My guess is that the initial is indeed a stock cut with some element of personal branding. Later members of the Sessa dynasty adopted the cat more prominently. See, for example, the 1539 edition of Pietro Aaron's "Toscanello in musica" (Venice: Melchiorre Sessa; Newberry shelfmark Case folio V 5 .012), which includes the Sessa cat on its title page.
