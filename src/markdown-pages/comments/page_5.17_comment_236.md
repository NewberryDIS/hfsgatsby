It would be great to be able to draw this broad a conclusion, but I don't think we have the evidence to support it one way or the other. Parents' voices are hard to find in the surviving sources; they tended to vote their preferences merely by sending their children to one school or another. In section 5.13-16, I try to explicate what little evidence the textbooks themselves offer --merely to the point that there was some demand for alternative schools. Sales records and shop inventories offer a few more clues.




There is one other potential source. To some degree, we can imagine that the laymen in city councils, who felt that they should be overseeing education in their towns, spoke for the parents. So, when there are recorded city council debates, that is a potential source. A good study of one such town is by Christopher Carlsmith on Bergamo, forthcoming from University of Toronto press.
