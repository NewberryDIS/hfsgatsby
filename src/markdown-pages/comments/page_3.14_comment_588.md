Hi, Paige. Your question is one of the big issues in the scholarship on the Renaissance. The relationship of humanism to the church is not an easy one to describe, because there were so many different solutions, almost as many as there were serious thinkers in the period. Mancinelli is writing on the eve of the Reformation, when many intellectuals were dissatisfied with the corruption of the church and their relative inability to effect reforms. Manicnelli,however, seems to have been a pretty conformist type. He is very devoutly religious and does not seem to have felt there was any real or necessary break between classical scholarship and Christian orthodoxy. I suspect this was a common stance among humanists, especially those of the second rank. It is worth remembering in this regard that, although I have devoted an entire chapter to him, Mancinelli was not one of the great thinkers of the period. He was a famous teacher (and most teachers are good but not necessarily great thinkers).
