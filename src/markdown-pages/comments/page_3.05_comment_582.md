Hi, CM! It is always difficult to speculate about motives absent specific evidence, but in Mancinelli's case we have a rich body of prefaces and personal and business letters that address many of the points you raise. You are correct to see Mancinelli's motives in the context of public education (though at the period we have to remember that that left out most working class people and almost all women). I think the key to his attitude is in his small-town origins, where a cadre of local notables wanted to improve education locally. It's unlikely than any of them could see to see the results we do as a result of printing --really widespread literacy. But Mancinelli did recognize printing immediately as a tool for making his job easier and making his students' work easier too.
