Alvares' Ciceronianism was not merely a matter of extracting good examples for grammar students. He was a skilled orator himself, and composed a panegyric in praise of King JoaÌƒo III of Portugal in which he repeatedly addresses Cicero personally, inviting him to behold how the cultural patronage and political virtues of JoaÌƒo compared with the best rulers of antiquity. See Alvares, <em>Obra literaÌria completa</em>, cit. above at section 5.05, pp. 55-71.
