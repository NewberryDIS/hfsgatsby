I went back this morning to the most recent work I know on Hunger, just a few pages really in Koehler. He gives a brief bio of Hunger, who matriculated at Ingolstadt and taught there later in life after a peripatetic youth. It seems unlikely that he knew nothing at all of the early Jesuits, but there is also no indication that he was influenced by them. If anything, the influence would have been in the other direction, since our best guess as to the origin of Jesuit emblem-making (which flourished mostly after 1580) is that it started in Germany under the influence of German humanist schools like those Hunger envisions.
