"This larger work appeared in 1613 in Spanish, a significant choice, for it must have been aimed in the first instance at the largely Spanish-speaking public of monks and nuns in aristocratic religious houses at Naples. Eventually it would be read widely in Spain and even in New Spain." Have you come across cheaper music books that were also specifically designed for the Spanish market, or ones in Latin exported to the Spanish world? Thanks!
