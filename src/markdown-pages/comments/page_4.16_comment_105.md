I don't remember seeing any citations from Albert the Great, but all the humanist toponymic treatises are omnivorous --they take their information from whatever sources they think are credible. Lilio is careful to say he is excluding recent sources he thinks are unreliable in favor of impeccably classical ones, and this can be taken to refer to the fifteenth-century explorers as well as to medieval learned work.
