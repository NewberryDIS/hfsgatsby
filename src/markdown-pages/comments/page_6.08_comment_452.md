Thanks for your note, Monica! Although many of the early writing books are dated, there is some dispute as to their actual dates of publication. I based this very summary sentence and much of the rest of my account on A.S. Olsey's *Scribes and Sources*, which suggests that the 1522 *Operina* of Arricghi was rushed into print in order to anticipate Tagliente's known plan to publish, and that the actual date of its appearance was 1523, not 1522. That would put it very close in date to Tagliente's 1524 book. It is certainly clear from the date on the 1522 *Operina* that Arrighi wanted us to believe that his book was first.
