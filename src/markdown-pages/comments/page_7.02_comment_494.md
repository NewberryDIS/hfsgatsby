Yes, that's true. But the regional variations were even wider than just education. Keep in mind that most emblem books at most periods and in most places were not tied closely either to formal education or to schools. They were intended for personal reading, meditation, and enjoyment. They were most often connected to schools in Northern Europe, especially in the Low Countries and Germany, and the Jesuits (see section 13 below) particularly used them.
