The format of this book has some spectacular advantages. The ability to move between sections easily is really helpful for referencing material in other parts of the book. Also, the integration of images with zoom-in capability allows the reader to better understand each textual example. I really like that other scholars and readers can comment on specific sets of information, ideally to enhance the book by bringing in new insights. The organization into chapter sub-divisions does pose some issues for me because the chapters seem overly-fragmented and disconnected. The comment section on each page also seems a bit too large, pushing the text too far to one side. I do think this original type of format has the potential to spread, especially with the ability to jump between various sections and images. The vast majority of e-books do not have such accessible images. The book, however, could benefit from less sub-divisions and more prominent text. I understand this is a difficult balance to achieve.
