Actually, early modern people saw books as instruments or tools and that meant they felt very free to mark them up --both for their personal use and for the use of other people who would use them. One by-product of the relative scarcity of books was that many individuals would often use a single book, either together or across time. My personal favorites are brothers and sisters, parents and children who put their names in a single books, sometimes across several generations.
