I don't know for sure, Rick, but I don't see any direct parallel in the texts that accompany the image. Alciati references Epicharnus of Kos for the moral advice --a quotation he may have gotten from any number of sources, perhaps most likely Diogenes Laertes-- and the Heraclitus story, both of which seem to fit better into a personal-moral than a mystical framework.
