One example of a souvenir calligraphic manuscript copybook produced for the tourist trade is the Bernardino Cataneo Manuscript (Houghton MS Typ 246) acquired from the scribe by "Signor Odoardo Ralyg Gentilhuomo Inglese" in 1545. Cataneo, who did not publish any known writing book, was a maestro di scrivere at the University at Siena. For further info, see "An Italic Copybook: The Cataneo Manuscript" by Stephen Harvard (N.Y.: Taplinger, 1981)
