For a good, brief overview of the career of Bordone, a humanist-trained miniaturist, woodcut artist, and cosmographer, see now, *Benedetto Bordon, a Life in the World of Books*, the catalogue to an exhibition "In Praise of Aldus Manutius (ca. 1452-1515)" (New York: PrPh Books, 2015). This handsome small volume cites much of the recent literature which ascribes a remarkable variety of works to Bordone.
