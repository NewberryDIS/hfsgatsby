As Dan Sheerin points out above, the establishment (as we would say today) was both clerical and lay and so deeply intertwined that we may rightly consider them one ruling class. Both groups found challenges as well as opportunities in the arrival of printing and its popularizing force. The extensive recent literature on these themes is expounded in detail in Rosa Salzberg, <em>Ephemeral City, Cheap Print and Urban Culture in Renaissance Venice </em>(Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2014); see especially pp. 32-38.
