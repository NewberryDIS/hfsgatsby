Yes, popularizations, but also propagation of humanist culture. There was a struggle at every level between humanism and what one might call traditional scholasticism (not limiting the term to philosophy/theology but to the whole cursus of late medieval education). Humanistic Latin, bonae litterae, and new or revived pedagogies were at once the emblems and the cultural capital of the humanists.
