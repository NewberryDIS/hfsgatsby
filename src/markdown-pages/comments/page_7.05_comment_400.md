Lauren: Both you and Sean are here pointing to a kind of reading that was applied to texts as well as pictorial works during the Middle Ages. In that period the number of readers was small and they concentrated in communities that could easily be policed. The issue for the authorities in the first age of print was exactly the one that moralizing (or politically controlling) public figures today use to suggest we should censor the internet --that people cannot be trusted to use the media.
