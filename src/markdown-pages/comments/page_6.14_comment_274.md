I don't know the answer to this one, Jane. I have never heard seen reference to a case, but I am not up on all the (considerable) literature about prosecutions for magic. It might be something you could keep an eye out for in the kinds of inquisitorial court documents you see in our own research.(I am always surprised where everyday things like textbooks turn up in documents.) But your suggestion that these were slight and unimportant books is also to the point. The sixteenth-century ones are not as concerned with magic as the medieval ones, and the superstitious elements are relatively trivial.
