With handwriting, vernacular seems to have been the norm from the very beginning. I know of only one writing manual in the 16th century with instructions in Latin: Mercator's "Literarum latinarum" of 1541, although many writing manuals &amp; copybooks included passages in Latin. This was due to a convention of writing certain languages in certain hands which, in turn probably produced more work for writing teachers.
