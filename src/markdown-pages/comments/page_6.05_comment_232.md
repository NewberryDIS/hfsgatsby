You are certainly right that there was relatively little to differentiate basic math content from one book to another. But the teachers did find themselves involved with the different commercial traditions of towns where they taught. Venice and Florence were great rivals, but every small town had its own set of weights and measures, its own currency, etc. So there is plenty of room to sell different styles and methods of teaching.
