In addition to the sources cited in note 61, there is now a new essay on Petrarch's Itinerarium by Theodore J. Cachey, in <em>Petrarch, A Critical Guide to the Complete Works</em> (University of Chicago Press, 2009), 229-241. Cachey makes the important point that for Petrarch, the imaginary, uneven, and highly episodic journey of the Itinerarium was a reflection of the author's literary wanderings. At exactly a period of relative stability in his domestic life, Petrarch restlessly travelled back and forth from one work-in-progress to another.
