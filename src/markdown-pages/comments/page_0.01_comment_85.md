Can't argue with Lewis and Short, but in my reading of the larger debate, the term has a strongly linguistic dimension colored by the humanists' emphasis on the recovery of ancient usages. Although the humanists as rhetoricians were always trying to achieve a "pure ... style," that translation doesn't quite get at the pervasiveness of the linguistic urge.
