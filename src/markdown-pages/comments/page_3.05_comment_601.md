Hi, Emily. I don't think there is an either-or here. Good teachers adopt the best textbooks, and though there are many other things that go into marketing textbooks, class is not very overtly one of them. Certainly, private tuition was restricted to the wealthy --either aristocrats or well-to-do merchant families-- but the teacher will use the texts that best fits his/her students' needs. What differs is that a private tutor can use pretty much any text, manuscript or printed, and tailor the curriculum closely to one or two students, while a schoolmaster is going to find distinct advantages in using printed texts that are designed for use by many students in a single classroom.




To your other point, Montaigne-style reflective reading and meditation, this was an ideal for most humanists, but it is largely a goal for intermediate and advanced students, not for grammar school kids.
