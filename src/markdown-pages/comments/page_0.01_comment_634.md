It will be clear from this section that my approach to humanism in this book is largely commercial. As comments here and again at the end of the book (in chapter 8) reveal, however, this is only a partial view, and many scholars take exception to my emphases. The recent republication of Maury Feld's several essays on early printing remind me that he presented a richly nuanced view of the commercial dimensions of humanism (very limited in his view) in a series of essays that appeared in the *Harvard Library Bulletin*. See now, however, M.D. Feld, *Printing and Humanism in Renaissance Italy: Essays in the Revival of the Pagan Gods* (Rome: Roma nel Rinascimento, 2015), especially pp. 176-181, i.e. the section of chapter 6 headed, "Cottage Enterprise -- Court Enterprise."
