Out of curiosity, was the printer's mark ever manipulated by publishers publishing soon-to-be censored or censored material in any unorthodox or politically/religiously taboo fashion (i.e. did publishers ever craft an ironic printer's mark which mocked a particular group, such as Protestants or Catholics?)? As seen in the "Simplicissimus Teutsch" title page, emblems and title pages can be intentionally misleading. Were printer's marks, too, capable of this degree of creative freedom when publishing more socially/politically objectionable material?
