Another interesting document for the wide distribution of Terence is an inventory of a 1595 book 'caravan' published recently by Anastasio Rojo Vegas. Among the books sent from Valladolid (a major book entrepot) to Santiago (in much more provincial Galicia), there are six entries for Terence, including at least one used copy, two copies of a Spanish translation, and eight new copies of Latin editions in quarto and sextodecimo. See: Rojo Vegas, "From Europe to Finisterre: A Caravan of Books to Galicia (1595)," in *Print Culture and Peripheries in Early Modern Europe*, ed. by Benito Rial Costas (Leiden: Brill, 2013), pp. 381-401, at 391.
