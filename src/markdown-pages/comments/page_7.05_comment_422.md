This section answers my question on 7.02. And I think the idea Emblem books is very interesting. And I agree that it requires "an activist kind of reading that engaged the mind in problem solving". I remember, in class when we read the book "Der abenteuerliche Simplicissimus Teutsch", we had lots of discussion about the emblem on the front page. It's really requires an active learning. We tried to figure out what the pictures represented and there was no clear answer.
