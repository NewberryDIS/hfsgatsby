While reading this paragraph I was reminded of the fourth paragraph of chapter 3.02, "œAdvertising Oneself." There the text says that Pellisson's embarrassment of his work suggests a difference between renown and worth of a publication. Then the following paragraph in 3.02 (paragraph five) contrasts Pellisson's reaction to the flaws in his text with Mancinelli's response to the flaws in his own work. Despite the different reactions, the idea of a difference between acclaim and quality seem to resonate with this section (3.09). Since Mancinelli eventually decided to reprint his texts, he was able to increase the quality of his work so that its worth could be closer to the acclaim that it received. In this way, the ability to reprint sounds like an important triumph for education. Additionally, I wonder how much more accessible it made educational materials to the masses. I was wondering if the prices of Mancinelli's books would have been more competitive too-- making the older editions more accessible to those without the means for a high quality education. From what I know about education during the Renaissance, some scholars (such as Montaigne) were mostly concerned with educating the nobles. Did Mancinelli's production of textbooks-- especially as he competed with himself-- contribute to a more universal education?
