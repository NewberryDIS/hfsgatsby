This detail shows the passage quoted in the next paragraph. If you click on it, you will see the entire title page of this edition by the highly successful Sessa-family publishing firm at Venice. (In this case the imprint is "heirs of Marchio Sessa.") As in the Valgrisi title page above, the advertising prose is kept in tiny type so as to provide room for the firm's trademark. When rival firm's took on Fabrini's text, they typically varied the wording and order of the advertising prose but reproduced the list of features on offer to prove that their edition was just as good as others on the market.
