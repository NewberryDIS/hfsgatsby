Fascinating. On-demand custom printing was not invented in the 1990s. In fact, there will be a curve away from customizability as industrialization increases: the page makeup processes get more specialized, presses become larger and faster, and the distance from man to work increases. Now we have a curve back toward the personalization. But the system is so complex now that teachers still can't customize very well. What most teachers do for customization is photocopying.
