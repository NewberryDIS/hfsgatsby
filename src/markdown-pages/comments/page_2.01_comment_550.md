As the citations in note 2 here indicate, there has been a considerable amount of scholarship about the elementary curriculum since Lucchi called attention to new sources in his important 1978 article. Most of the work has concentrated on the Trecento and early Quattrocento --the classic period for studies of humanism-- and there is as yet no consensus about the tranformations of the curriculum wrought by printing. A good basic summary of the results of this research appears in an essay by Robert Black in the Short Oxford History of Italy volume entitled *Italy in the Age of the Renaissance 1300-1550*, ed. John M. Najemy (Oxford University Press, 2004). For that same (pre-print), Latin educational world, see also the monographic issue of the University of Rome's "Studi (e testi) italiani" edited in 2006 by Emilio Russo and entitled, *Testimoni del vero. Su alcuni libri in biblioteche d'autore*. Of particular interest is the essay by Giuseppina Brunetti and Sonia Gentili, "Una biblioteca nella Firenze di Dante," op. cit. pp. 21-55.
