It is interesting to note that with the advent of music printing in the early 16th century, many of what we can call "interpretive actions" (embellishments, diminutions or divisions, and so forth), which were frequently dependent on a direct contact between musicians (including teacher and pupil), could now be mastered also by those who had little contact with the performing scene. Just like with the invention of musical notation, the distance between composer and performer/interpreter received another push.
