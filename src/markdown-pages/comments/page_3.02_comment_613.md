I think it is interesting too, Julia, not only because it <em>does</em> reflect fairly widespread complaints about printers and publishers who hijack an author's intent or misrepresnt his text, but also in this case because Pellisson is writing in the 1520s, when the benefits and dangers of going to press should have been obvious to most authors. It is speculation on my part, but I suspect that in this case Pellisson (still in his 20s) was flattered that a printer would want to publsih his text and let it go to press without careful supervision.
