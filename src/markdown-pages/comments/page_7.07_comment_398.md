I like this (imperfect) analogy to Facebook, Sean! It points to the way the tools are handed to us and we make of them what we will, largely unfettered by the intentions of the toolmakers. The makers of emblems seem (after Alciati's apparent initial shock at the way the form got away from him) to have accepted the notion of readers inventing new puzzles on the basis of the published emblems. Unlike printed emblems, of course, the Facebook page owner actually can change what is published, what the public encounters, while the user of an emblem had to be in a position to publish a new book in order to do that. The issue of who cares about how tools are used is perennial, however. Just to take the Facebook analogy one step further, recall how incensed people got a few weeks ago when Facebook changed some parameters --and indeed how annoying it is when any software update takes away familiar patterns of use.
