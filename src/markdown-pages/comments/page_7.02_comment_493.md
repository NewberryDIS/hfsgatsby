If I understand this correctly, the emblem book was supplementary by default, but it was also part of a dialogue between children's education and formalized education - which would seem to suggest that the material in each emblem book (varying, as you say, by region) would have a specific perspective or slant, focusing on different aspects of education in a way that fit the expectations of education in that region? Or is that saying too much?
