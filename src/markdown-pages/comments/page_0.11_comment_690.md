I am intrigued by the implied potential that digital books such as this one might be able to condense the lag between cutting-edge theory and on-the-ground pedagogy. The ability to modify the text to reflect new developments ensures at the very least the gap will not widen. Comments also offer the possibility of an always-updating paratext that can incorporate realtime debates in the field. However, this assumes sustained reader engagement with the text. It seems to me that one of the big requirements for the success of the interactive ebook model is vibrant audience participation. What tools do we have open to us to ensure this participation? How do we advertise these resources to the audience that will most benefit from them? It seems like Humanism For Sale has been very successful in drawing in an active body of interlocutors. How was this accomplished?
