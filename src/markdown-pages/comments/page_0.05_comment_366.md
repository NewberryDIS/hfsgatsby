I was wondering too about the literacy rates. Roughly how many readers would be in these classrooms? Also, I know that in medieval manuscripts, the monks who wrote the texts did not usually illustrate the texts. Is this the same in printing? Would artists be commissioned to incorporate images to the texts?
