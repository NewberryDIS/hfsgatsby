In all probability, the woodcut frame here is a separate woodblock from the cut of the teacher; and the caption above the cut is set in type, so it too is a separate item supplied by the printer. Given the generally high degree of pretension of this book, we may assume the elements were chosen to be reasonably coherent and pertinent to the text, but it is worth remembering that they are also stock cuts.
