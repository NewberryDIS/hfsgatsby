I think you have put our finger on one of the important factors that limited state intervention in Italy. Throughout the period, there was a great deal of debate as to whether it was a positive social good to educate non-elite citizens, and there was a strong party of opinion against it. Local churches in Italy came down strongly in favor of catechism education (Doctrina Christiana --see below, sections 6.11 and 6.12), involving reading and sometimes writing, but there was no impulse comparable to that in N. Europe to go much beyond the elementary skills needed for devotion.
