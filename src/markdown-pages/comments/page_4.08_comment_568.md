By contrast to this Italian reader's interest in philological errors (especially those of his countrymen), the reader (probably German) of a copy of the Art of Verse (Spauter 1512) now at the Newberry Library has marked up the preface with notes that mostly display interest in Spauter's rhetorical ability to skewer his adversaries with pointed insults. Treatises on verse were often marked up with indexes that helped their owners use vocabulary correctly and effectively in their own verse; this reader was clearly interested in prose rhetoric as well.
