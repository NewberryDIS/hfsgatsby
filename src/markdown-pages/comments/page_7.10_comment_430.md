The conventions of publishing in this period are pretty fixed --only one title page, which is why it becomes a contested field. The solution when there was more than one party was often for the printer to put his mark at the end of the book, ceding the title page to the more prestigious author, academy, or public institution. Toward the very end of the sixteenth century you have the phenomenon of the second title page --usually an elaborate, engraved plate that was a good place for really extended emblem-making. This would be followed by a typographic title page with just the discursive information.
