I very much like your conclusion to this







chapter. It pulls everything together

so well. In fact the books --

textbooks for a number of different 

disciplines -- you've been talking 

about do evince a new mentalite:

an interest, as you say, in self-help

or how-to manuals and a new valuing

of the quantitative arts and sciences.

The trend, as you note, is toward the

conquering nature and the

privileging of quantification. Have you

included these important conclusions

in the Intro to the book?
