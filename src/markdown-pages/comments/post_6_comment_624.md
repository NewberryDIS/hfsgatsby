Hi, Jemy. Your notes are good ones, all things we need to put on a list for an eventual revision of the site. *Humanism For Sale* was published in 2008 with off-the-shelf software dating from 2006 or so, and so it is way out of date nowadays. The hand-held devices we use so much today didn't exist then, so it is no surprise the site does not work well in those formats.
