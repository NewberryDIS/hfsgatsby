The "long sixteenth century" is mentioned a number of times in this book (including here). Do you mean that to refer to the entire two-century period 1450-1650? Or, are you following another scholar's lead in defining a shorter period? If there's a gloss someplace for your use of the term and its justification, I missed it.
