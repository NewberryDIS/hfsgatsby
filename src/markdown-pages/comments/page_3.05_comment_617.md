You mentioned earlier that humanism and humanistic teachings experienced a rather quick decline in popularity, and I was wondering if you agree that technological innovation was a main contributing factor in this abrupt decline. In my opinion, there must be an equilibrium of sort between education and innovation, especially from a humanistic perspective. While bulk printing allowed more students access to education, it also forced students to learn in a specified way that seems to contradict many humanist teachings. You touch on this with your comment that "speedy learning of this sort is most beneficial to the student who is a quick study". While Mancinelli claims to be a humanist, it appears that as he becomes more invested in himself and innovating the "humanist classroom", he loses sight of the ideals that shape humanistic education.
