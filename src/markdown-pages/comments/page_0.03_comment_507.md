This is true, Peter, though not entirely a new problem. Dealers' printed catalogs always included useful information (my files are filled with tear sheets or photocopies). Some libraries created indexes to this material, and digitization has allowed for more and more of it to be stored and used. But you are really pointing to a different problem entirely, the fragility of records that are created only on line. Capturing that information would alleviate one other problem, the cases of very rare survivals that emerge on the market for a moment and then disappear back into private collections where they may remain hidden to interested scholars for a generation or longer.
