Somehow I missed this string back in 2009 - 2010. I hope that, as readers went along beyond this admittedly rather artificial transition, they discovered the link with humanism, namely that all these popularizing books derived more or less directly from humanist textbooks (yes, even for elementary maths), and that the translation of such elitist knowledge into the public sphere through print was in fact a critical problem faced by humanist educators.
