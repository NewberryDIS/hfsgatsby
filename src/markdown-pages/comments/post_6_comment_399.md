Hi, Greta: Your note raises an interesting question, but I don't have an easy answer. I certainly have not come across this image myself. The sources for most emblems are literary (usually but not always classical (and do not come directly from medical writings. The Blessed Virgin and writings about her, however, are sources for a few emblem books created in Italy, as discussed in section 7.14, where I think you originally posted this comment.
