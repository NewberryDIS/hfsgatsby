Ponce de LeÃ³n, <em>AproximaciÃ³n</em>, xxxix-xlii explicates the fact that in Alvares' classroom and in the Portuguese editions of his grammars, extensive use was made of explanatory notes comparing Portuguese to Latin usage. These notes do not appear in the Italian editions, but Romeo concludes that they were an essential part of Alvares' teaching method.
