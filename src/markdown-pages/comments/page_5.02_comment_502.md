Right, Peter. We have this rather exaggerated opinion of the power and conformity of the Jesuit order that derives in part from the realities of Jesuit life codified in the seventeenth century and in part from a long Anglo-American political and historiographical tradition of distrust for the order. In the 1550s, however, the order was still new; it was composed of many dedicated and often brilliant men who knew St. Ignatius personally, and who were quickly scattered to many parts of Europe. The later centralization was not yet in place. What fascinates me most about the Alvares grammar is that it was one of the first products in publishing history to gain anything like the popularity and widespread influence that even a routine Microsoft release gets today.
