This project is remarked by Paola Farenga (cit. in comment to section 3.09, para 3 above, p. 427-428), who assumes that publishing such lists of works was a response to 'pirated' or unauthorized editions. In my reading, however, the early lists are straightforward advertising, while the later ones signal a shift by Mancinelli or his publishers to creating unified sets of his works for the more sophisticated, international market for which Venetians printed. It is really not necessary to see this as a response to unauthorized printings.
