You are right to note that I use it fairly loosely and inclusively. In general I take the whole range from 1450 to 1650, as noted at the very start (section 0.01, with specific reference in footnote 2 to John Marino's and Chris Celenza's discussions of periodization). This makes sense in publishing terms since it includes everyone in print from Gutenberg forward, and the fuzzy upward border allows us to include many highly conservative publications that appeared well into the seventeenth century but embodying much earlier educational practice.
