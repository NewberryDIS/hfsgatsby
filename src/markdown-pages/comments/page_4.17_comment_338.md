Italians may have been isolated from New World discoveries, although given that Italian navigators and innovations were vital to the initial imperial adventures of those other states, I wonder if there was an initial interest that died off once Spain, et al., developed independence from that Italian aid. But at the same time, Italy was where refugees from Byzantium traveled, and had more direct contact with the Arab and Turkish worlds - through the attempted Ottoman invasions, trade contacts, and as a site to prepare for Christian counter-attacks on the Muslim world - than many of those same imperial powers who were focused on the New World. So I wonder, is there any evidence that while Spanish, Dutch., etc., humanists were more receptive to the geographic and naturalistic discoveries of the New World, Italian humanists may have still been receptive to discoveries and contact in the other direction, ie, with the Eastern world? Or by the 15th/16th centuries, had the knowledge of the Muslim world been largely diffused throughout Christendom already?
