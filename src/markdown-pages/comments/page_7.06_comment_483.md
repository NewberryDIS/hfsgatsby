It's interesting to see during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it was widespread practice to use images to add more layers of complexity, even in every day settings. I was wondering, how much difference in terms of obscurity/complexity would there be in an image that would be found in a textbook, as compared to an image on a poster or storefront? Would a book image necessarily be much more intellectually demanding in nature? And how long did this practice of using "œinventional" images in daily settings persist "“ is this practice considered to still be around in the same form today?
