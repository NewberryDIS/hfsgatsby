You're the second person to refer to the Simplicissimus Teutsch, Ky. I will have to find some time today to look at it myself. In general, there is plenty of irony in printer's marks as in emblems more generally (and it is rife in Renaissance literary culture as a whole), but I cannot offhand think of an example that deliberately mocks a denominational group. False marks --or none at all-- were, however, sometimes used on heterodox publications. As such they could be considered another kind of false imprint statement.
