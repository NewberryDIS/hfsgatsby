We know a great deal more about the circumstances of Mancinelli's teaching, especially late in his career, since Dugald McLellan has located and published a very rich series of documents concerning Mancinelli's stint in Orvieto. See his *Antonio Mancinelli ad Orvieto* (2014), cit. above at section 3.0 par. 1.
