I have been navigating the Humanism For Sale website for about a week. It took me a little while to get used to the format, but now I really like the way it works. It's a very different experience than reading a book. I find it easier to get an idea of the content as a whole, most likely because it's so easy to go between chapters, much easier than flipping pages.
