I found this part very important because it shows that the mass production of print textbooks allowed a large population of learners to access some material and information more proficiently than with manuscripts. Also, the fact that the it promotes "standardized curricula" is appealing because by that, we can see the movement of one or two individuals leads towards the goal of a global movement, with some elaborated rules and principles. I would like to know hat kind of difficulties such a movement could have faced to finally be efficient because, as we know there is no (r)evolution without possible deadlock.
