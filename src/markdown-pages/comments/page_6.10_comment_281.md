Unknown to me at the time of writing, there is also another small Verini booklet (not reported in my bibliography yet because I have not seen it). This appears to be a commercial arithmetic, though with a typical-for-Verini ambiguous, jocose title: Specchio del mercantante: libro de abaco et gioco di memoria. The unique recorded copy (EDIT16:CNCE58079) is at the Trivulziana library in Milan.
