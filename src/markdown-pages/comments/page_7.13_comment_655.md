Since *Humanism For Sale* was originally published (2008), the field of Jesuit emblem studies has flourished. A particularly useful volume of essays that addresses both the Jesuits' theories about emblems and a variety of examples of emblem making is Wietse de Boer, Karl A.E. Enenkel and Walter S. Melion (eds.), *Jesuit Emblem Theory*, Leiden, Brill, 2016.
