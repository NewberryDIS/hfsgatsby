It may well have been an Aldine invention -- I cannot remember seeing it in earlier editions. Clearly it was intended to help the reader, but of course many speeches begin in the middle of a poetic line too, for example, toward the end of the second line on the right-hand page in this illustration. Some sixteeenth-century editions use all-caps abbreviations for the characters, which make the reading even easier.
