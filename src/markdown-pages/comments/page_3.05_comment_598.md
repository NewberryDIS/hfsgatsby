I'm not sure what you are getting at here, Abdoul, but you are certainly right that printing allowed the creation of textbooks as market objects in competition with each other for use in the schools. I don't think this resulted in making humanists into merchants or humanism into a commercial enterprise, but it did mean that one part of the humanist achievement, went on the market in a way that was not true before printing. This is the import of my title Humanism For Sale.




The Jesuits are the subject of a later chapter, and you can actually read their educational work as an attempt to corner the market.
