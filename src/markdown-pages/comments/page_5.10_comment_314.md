In addition to the small grammar mentioned in the comment on paragraph 2 above, Pescetti also penned a full-length Latin grammar which I have not been able to examine. As of this writing it is recorded in a single copy at the Biblioteca Civica di Verona: *Grammaticae insitutiones magna exemplorum copia instructae *(Verona, Merlo, 1618), reported by Federica Formiga, *I Merlo tipografi veronesi fra Sei e Settecento* (Florence, Olschki, 2009), p. 139. If this is a first edition, it postdates the entire Jesuit controversy and may have been intended as a reply to the counterattack of the Jesuits (the last word as far as we knew it when *Humanism For Sale* was published now two years ago) described in sections 5.11 and 5.12 below.
