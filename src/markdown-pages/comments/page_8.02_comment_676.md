For the rhetoric of print, prefaces are among the most important sources, and the prefaces of Aldo Manuzio are among the most persuasive and elegant in enunciating a humanist publishing program. The entire corpus was published in 1975 by Carlo Dionisotti, *Aldo Manuzio editore* (Milan, Il Polifilo), but there is now a highly accessible and usable edition of selected prefaces in Italian translation: Mario Infelise and Tiziana Plebani (eds.), *Aldo Manuzio , la voce dell'editor*e (Venice, Marsilio, 2015).
