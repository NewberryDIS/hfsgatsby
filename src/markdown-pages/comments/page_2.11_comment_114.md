Thanks for this comparison to the page at 0.08, Susan. They do represent two kinds of final effect, in that this one is partial and largely done by a single reader, while the page at 0.08 is completely covered by marks made by at least three childish readers across a period of time we cannot determine. I will add a few notes there, just to make that point clearer to other readers.
