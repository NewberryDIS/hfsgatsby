An interesting critique both of the Donat and *Doctrinale* and of the early humanist attempts (like Guarino's) to replace them was penned in the 1470s by Tommaso Ferrando, a printer and grammarian at Brescia who claimed to have devised an entirely new method of teaching grammar but never published his invention. See Alessandro Tedesco, "Le racolte epistolografiche del tipografo Tommaso Ferrando," in *La lettura e i libri tra chiostro, scuola e biblioteca*, Udine, Forum, 2017, 77-130, esp.103-108 and 123-125.
