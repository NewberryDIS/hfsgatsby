Innovation is never quite this radical in the fifteenth century and even less so in conservative areas like language teaching. While it is true that printing had the potential to standardize instruction across schools and whole regions, that happened only slowly and certainly did not come to fruition in Mancinelli's lifetime. Moreover, Mancinelli never abandoned his humanist ideals. He was happy to adopt the new technology, but I think it was pretty much impossible for someone in his generation to make a radical break with the ideals he inherited from earlier humanists.
