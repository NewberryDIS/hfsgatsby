In her new book, *Women, Language and Grammar in Italy 1500-1900* (British Academy, 2011), p. 46, n. 59, Helena Sanson says that there were over thirty five editions of the *Libro maistrevole*. I have not been able to verify this point, but if true, it would of course alter my statement here about Tagliente's reading of his audience.
