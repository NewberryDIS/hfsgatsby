You are right, I hope, that you will find most of the answers to these questions in the rest of the chapter. But I should perhaps explain "largely autobiography." Mancinelli was well known in his day a s a teacher and editor, but that was really not what we think of as celebrity. No one much wrote about Mancinelli except himself, so, although we can piece together many details of his life, they all come from his own writings.
