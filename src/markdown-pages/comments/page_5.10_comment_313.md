Pescetti also authored a small Latin textbook, which I have never seen: *Tabulae ad grammaticam celeriter et feliciter perdiscendum utilissimae, in quibus uno velut intuiti, quicquid ad hanc artem pertinet, inspicere licet *(Verona, Tamo, 1600). This title implies that it took the form of a summary aimed at beginners. At this date it was clearly intended as part of Pescetti's campaign against the Alvares grammar.
