If "Adagia" as defined usually do not have much of a moral component (as one sees in, e.g., Erasmus's blushing gloss of "Tussus pro crepitu," Adagia I vi 63), it may be worth emphasizing that addenda to successive editions of the collection often included moralizing that could be quite heavy-handed.

A fine essay (not mentioned in the bibliography, so far as I can see) that bears directly upon the thinking about ethics that could be inspired by reading the "Adagia" is: Peter Mack, "Rhetoric, ethics and reading in the Renaissance," _Renaissance Studies_ 19 (2005): 1"“21. See esp. pp. 9"“11.
