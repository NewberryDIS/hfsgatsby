A particularly good introduction to the kinds of sources for textbook history is provided for the specific case of sixteenth-century Zurich by Urs B. Leu, "Textbooks and their Uses --An Insight into the Teaching of Geography in 16th century Zurich," in <em>Scholarly Knowledge: Textbooks in Early Modern Europe</em>, Geneva, Droz, 2008, pp. 229-248, esp. 229-237.
