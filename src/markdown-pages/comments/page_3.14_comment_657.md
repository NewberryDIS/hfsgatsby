Paola Farenga, cit. in comment to section 3.09, para 3 above, p. 415-416, notes that <em>On the Care of Parents</em> bears an epilogue in praise of Pietro Della Torre, a bookseller at Rome, who apparently subsidized the publication of the work with the education of his own three sons in mind. To my knowledge this is the only occasion on which Mancinelli remarks direct financial support for his publications from an individual. Della Torre, of course, was in a position to market the new book immediately and directly.
