This is an interesting anecdote. It is important to acknowledge life before the printing press and the true impact it had on people. It's interesting that Jean Pellisson did not realize the grand implications of allowing his work to be published. The fact that he regretted that decision because he felt insecure about his content now that a larger population would be reading his work is significant. Are there many other sources/anecdotes of writers during this time who felt similarly? Did other writers feel more insecure about their area of expertise now that more of the world would be reading if their works was to be published?
