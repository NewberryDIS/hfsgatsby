I have done some re-checking of my sources here and find that Edward's correction is accurate as far as the Auctores octo goes. Baldzuhn as cited remarks some 60 (mostly Northern European) manuscripts that combined Avianus with the Distichs of Cato. But the print collection, Auctores octo, always includes the Aesopian fables in the verse translation of Walter the Englishman, not Avianus.
