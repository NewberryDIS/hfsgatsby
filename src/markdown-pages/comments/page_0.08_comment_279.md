The brief discussion of annotation in this section is not intended to minimize the importance of such evidence for many kinds of book history, merely to suggest that there are particular cautions to be observed in the case of textbooks. The best synthetic study of marks in books, confined to English examples but useful methodologically for all, is William Sherman's <em>Used Books: Marking Readers in Renaissance England</em> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008).
