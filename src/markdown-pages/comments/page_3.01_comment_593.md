Mancineli was considered as one of the humanist in his generation. I knew that he was a grammarian and he taught in several cities such as; Rome, Venice. He used to print his poetry and his essays to help, improve and do the best for his students. He said that he has seen a significant impact on his students after the printed books.. I think that mancineli connected the humanism with the teaching.. So, what is his point in this relationship between both?
