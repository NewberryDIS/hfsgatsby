The link might well be there, but I don't know of any documentary evidence for it, merely the temporal coincidence you mention. I would have to look at the Giunta books in the period very closely to say exactly when the "Nil candidius" was added to their long-standing lily motif. I may just ask Bill Pettas (who published on the Spanish Giunta a few years back and is working on the Italian branches of the family now) to weigh in on this one.
