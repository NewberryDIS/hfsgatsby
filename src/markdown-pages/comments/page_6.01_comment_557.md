Distinctions of this sort occur in many kinds of literature that tried to bring the fruits of Latin learning to readers who had no facility in reading Latin. An interesting example, the Psalm translations of Lodovico Pittorio, apparently composed in 1522 and printed many times, are explicated by Ãˆlise Boilet, "La fortune du <em>Psalterio Davitico</em> de Lodovico Pittorio en Italie au XVIe siÃ¨cle," <em>La BibliofilÃ­a</em> 115 (2013), 621-628. The first edition is addressed to "persone divote & del latino ignare," ibid., p. 623n10.
