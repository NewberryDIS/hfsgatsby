I have just recently discovered Humanism for Sale. Thank you very much indeed for your generosity, in making such a high-quality work of scholarship so freely available online. Chapter 5 in particular is a find beyond my wildest hopes, and is of great assistance with a current research and review project relating to the fascinating Alvares Grammar. IMO your final conclusions regarding the work are particularly telling. I look forward to reading other sections online "â€œ sincere thanks again.
