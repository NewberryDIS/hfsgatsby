Good conclusion. I like the disavowals





and qualifications in this concluding

section. These modify some of the 

sweeping statements

you make earlier which sometimes

appear to equate textbook

pedagogy and the teaching of

elementary Latin with Renaissance 

humanism. Should you make the

distinction clearer in your introduction to the book? Just a question.
