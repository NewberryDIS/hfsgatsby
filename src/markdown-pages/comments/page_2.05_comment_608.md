I think you are right that this typographic style is a marketing device, and that it probably has to do with a sense of the psychology of the young student, who needs to be enticed into working hard at difficult subject like Latin. It is important to remember, however, that then as now, students didn't choose their own textbooks, so the marketing was by publishers (and sometimes textbook authors) to teachers who adopted the texts.
