I am intrigued by Soardi's logo on these pages, as it appears to be the same logo as Leo. S. Olschki Editore. Do you have any sense of why there might be this commonality (according to the Olschki website they were only established in 1886)? Is this a common logo (with varying letters, perhaps), that Olschki may have just taken up?
