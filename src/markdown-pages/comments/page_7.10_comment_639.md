This wonderful portrait has been attributed to the engraver Giovanni Breit who worked closely with Titian. Since Titian is mentioned in the preface to the book, scholars Giorgio Padoan and Terisio Pignatti argue that the original of the woodcut must have been a drawing or painting by Titian himself. See:*Tiziano e Venezia* (Vicenza, N. Pozza, 1980), pp 357-369 and figs. 223-226.
