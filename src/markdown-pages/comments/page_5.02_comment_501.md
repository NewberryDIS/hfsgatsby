It surprises me that the grammar books prior to Alvares were not more successful (Codret, des Fruex, de Ledesma) or long-lived. Regardless its flaws, I would think almost any book with the full weight of the Jesuit order behind it could have had at least modest international success. I hate most Microsoft products, but I still buy and use them.
