This certainly highlights the difficulty of the perpetual problem of dating printed writing books. I think that the 1522 date in "La Operina" refers to when Arrighi originally prepared his manuscript. Not only does Osley date it later but so does Stanley Morison. In his "Early Italian Writing-Books," edited by Nicolas Barker (1990), chapter 3 focuses on the publication date of "La Operina." Morison/Barker suggest it was probably printed in the first half of 1524. As you know, in 1525 the book's engraver, Ugo da Carpi, sued for the right to publish his edition. Morison/Barker raise the obvious question: if the book was published in 1522 why did Da Carpi wait 3 years to sue? They offer other substantial evidence as well.
