Your discussion of emblems is fascinating. You introduce, elucidate, and contextualize the genre (and its evolution) wonderfully; I've never read anything like it before.













I have been fascinated by the evolution of the title page, especially those that take the form of imaginary architectural spaces or cabinets of wonders that graphically attempting to represent or summarize a book's contents. I find what you have here immensely helpful. I'm thinking of <a href="http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/modernityimages_full/hobbes2-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">Hobbes's Leviathan</a> (http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/modernityimages_full/hobbes2-1.jpg) or of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mauerquadrant.jpg" rel="nofollow">Tycho Brahe's Mural Quadrant</a> (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mauerquadrant.jpg). 



It seems increasingly clear to me, that these two works referenced above from the 17th and late 16th centuries represent a further evolution of the same sort of verbal / visual interplay you describe here, whereas the designers attempt to render the whole of the text into the title page's picture plane. 



This leads me back to an earlier thought about this section on emblems. Initially, I wasn't convinced that your earlier description of "Emblem as Machine" (7.03) analogy made sense or, more likely, I felt I was missing something. As I got to thinking about the title page of Hobbes, I recollected that Hobbes begins his Leviathan with a series of interrelated metaphors linking together God and nature; man, machines ("engines"/"automata" in his words) and the higher form, (as he sees it) art. This leading to the visual metaphor depicted on his title page, whereas the Monarch is the brain (or reason) operating the cyborg "this artificial man" (part man / part machine in Hobbes's complex metaphor) whose body is composed of the Monarch's subjects but described with mechanical language (rather than biological, for example). 



Hobbes's nested and mixed metaphors are followed by a discussion of reading books vs. reading men vs. "reading thyself". He then returns to his earlier cyborg Monarch metaphor. When the Monarch is reading himself, he reads all of mankind. 



Hobbes creates a riddle-like metaphor-laden passage, which seems like an attempt to summarize the entirety of his book, very much like the model you describe here of emblems with their accompanying poem. With all of his mixed and/or nested metaphors it seems possible that his use of mechanical language also makes a connection between the play between emblem and text. Or, stated more simply, he seems to suggest that the text animates the emblem (this being the age of print, this animation plays out in our minds). The accompanying text provides the necessary code for how the emblem is to function (a code that wouldn't make sense on its own, or would at least remain incomplete, without the presence of the emblem itself). 



You discuss the role of medieval mnemonics as providing a model for the visual spaces of printed texts. Even in the Hobbes's (or Brahe's) texts we can see the spatial or room metaphor of the classic medieval mnemonics continue (whereas related information is stored spatially in particular rooms). The emblem seems to take this mnemonic out of the imagination onto the page, where it evolves overtime, still serving its mnemonic function but put to ever expanding uses. 



I apologize for this overlong (rambling) comment, but I am still left wondering about your use of the term "machine." By my count (and electronic texts make this easy!) you only use the phrase machine twice, once in the section "Emblem as Machine" (7.03) (and only in the very beginning of this section) and then again once more in section 7.15. 



In what sense are emblems machines? Perhaps this could use some more explaining. I think you are onto something but your use of the phrase still isn't clear too me. I think part of the difficulty maybe that it is a means of explaining the almost entirely unexplainable functioning across images and texts in a dynamic way. (This seems to be the reason Hobbes utilizes the language of machines.) 



These two OED definitions seem to be approaching what you mean:

"A material structure designed for a specific purpose, and related uses" (def. II, first used in late 16th century) and "An apparatus constructed to perform a task or for some other purpose" (def. IV, first used in mid-17th century).



I get why Hobbes, in his time, would look to the machine as a metaphor for animating his image via his text. This is of his time. Your discussing works predating Hobbes, and I'm not sure if this "animating" concept I described above is what you are getting at. It is a metaphor, but I still feel like I'm missing something with how it is used here. (And this could just be me, because I haven't had time to deeply read what you have here--which is one of the clearest and best discussions of emblems I've seen.)
