Further on the epigrams, see now the facsimile of the first edition with introduction and translation by Franco Lazzari and Mario Lozzi, *Gli epigrammi di Antonio Mancinelli*, Velletri, Centro Studi 'Antonio Mancinelli', 2009. The authors argue convincingly (pp. 26-29) that Mancinelli's preferment at Orvieto in 1495 and his subsequent return to teaching at Rome resulted from his successful cultivation of Cesare Borgia.
