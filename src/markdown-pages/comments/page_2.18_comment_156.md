Thanks for this correction to information that occurs in all the incunable records I have seen on line--most of them based on older bibliographies. Have you published the correct information somewhere, Dan, or has someone else? Needless to say, it requires noting that though the commentary of Filippo was known in Erasmus's day, it was not by a contemporary of his.
