I suggest here that such genres are not print-dependent inventions but matured only in the age of printing. In a thoughtful and important essay, Alberto Cevolini (cit. in comments to section 0.01 above, esp. pp. 289-90) describes this process of maturation, with specific reference to commonplace books, as a fundamental change in the technology of reading and study. His larger essay paints much the same picture for dictionaries and encyclopedias; and he includes a wide range of indexing and cataloging tools in the same transformation of learning.
