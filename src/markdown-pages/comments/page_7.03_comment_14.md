While looking at the emblems on the footnoted website did not add much to my understanding of emblem 126 (lioness/boar/vulture), emblem 6 (whore of Babylon), or emblem 110 (wingless Cupid), seeing emblem 16 (floating hand) did make a difference. The description alone did not work by itself to explain how the strange quality of the picture served as a memory device.
