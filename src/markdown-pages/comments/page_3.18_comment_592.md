Mancineli was considered one of the most humanist in his generation . I knew that he was a grammarian and he taught in several cities such as Rome and Venice. He print his works and his poetry to do the best in his classroom and develop his students. He connected the teaching with the humanism.

What is his point in this relationship between these both?
