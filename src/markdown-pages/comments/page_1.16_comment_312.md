Another significant use for Latin vocabulary studies was for Italian composition, since it was widely held that imitation of the classics would enrich the potential of Italian to achieve its full literary potential. A good example of a small manual with this aim is Girolamo Labella's *Regola della lingua tosca dell'ortographia volgare et Latina *(Venice, Rampazotto, 1570) which claims to be based on the personal teachings of grammarian Girolamo Cafaro. My thanks to Giles Mandlebrote for examining a copy of this rare work for me at Kings College, London.
