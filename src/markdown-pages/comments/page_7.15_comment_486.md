An excellent and highly original new account of the Italian <em>impresa</em> tradition and the ways in which it developed independently of the larger European emblem is provided by Susan Gaylard in <em>Hollow Men: Writing, Objects, and Public Image in Renaissance Italy</em>, New York, Fordham U. Press, 2013, chapter five. She also discusses academy emblems at length.
