It may well be a coincidence, but there is one concrete link. Clement was well known as a patron of the arts, and Arrighi, then in Rome and in the papal service, specifically compares the skills of a calligrapher to those of a musician. I am reasonably sure he had the numerous musicians of the papal chapel, and papal patronage for new music, in mind when he decided to go to press.
