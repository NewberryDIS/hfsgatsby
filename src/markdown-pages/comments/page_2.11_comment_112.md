PS to previous message. In the text there are several references to teaching a foreign language: that the children must be able to comprehend the meaning somehow right off - by similarities with their mother-tongue.

Very good observation. It's not too different with adults learning a foreign language! Too bad the US is not smaller, which would require us to become devoted to the learning of a foreign language or two or three -- out of economic necessity.
