As the images in this section clearly show, the window-in-frame layouts often resolved into multiple windows -- like rafts that seem to float on a sea of commentary. This created a lot of work for the typesetters; but it was actually valued as a design element by scholars who used the differing arrangements of the double-page spread mnemonically, to help them find passages they had seen before. The multiplication of index notes in the outer margins served something of the same function. This should remind us that reading and information-retrieval in the early years of printing did not depend so much on careful pagination and indexing as on the visual memory of expert readers.
