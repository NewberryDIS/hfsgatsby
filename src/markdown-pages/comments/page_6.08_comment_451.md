Dear Paul Gehl, I have a couple of questions: In this paragraph it is written that Tagliente's manual appeared in 1524, ... , within a year of one authored by Ludovico Arrighi (d. 1527). 1527 is three years later. I also have images of La Operina, by Ludovico Arrighi, dated 1522. Was Arrighi the first to publish a writing manual? Note 53, in chapter 6.09, does say that Arrighi's first book appeared before Tagliente's, was that book La Operina? Thank you
