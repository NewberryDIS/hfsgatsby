I also find your discussion of the emblem creating an active reader to be quite interesting, especially in relation to the concerns described in 7.01, that many educators feared mass-printed books would cause "permanent harm in a more natural oral / aural classroom." It appears, then, that emblems perhaps encouraged more discussion, due to their often ambiguous meaning. This idea of activist reading ties in nicely with the image of the emblem as a bridge "between textbook making and teaching."
