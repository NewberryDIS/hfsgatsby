A very few commentators have taken the position that <em>all</em> printed books functioned in an <em>essentially</em> commercial way. See most recently Alberto Cevolini, "Complessita` e tecnologizzazione del sapere," <em>La Bibliofilia</em> 118 (2016), 283-313, esp. 286-288. For Cevolini, the actual marketing and commercial exchanges around the buying and selling of books are secondary to market of ideas created by printing itself.
