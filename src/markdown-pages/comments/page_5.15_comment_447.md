My friend of many years, Father Conrad Borntrager, O.S.M., has just called my attention to a book on censorship at Lucca, which I am anxious to see for what light it might shed on the case of Aonio Paleario. It is Flavia Bruni, *"Erano di molti libri proibiti": Frate Lorenzo Lucchesi e la censura libraria a Lucca alla fine del Cinquecento*, Roma: Edizioni Marianum, 2009.
