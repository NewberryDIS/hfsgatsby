I find this to be an interesting addition to the history and story of Mancinelli. In his recreation of literature, we see the evolution of the thoughts, the structure, and the language. We now can also see that there is discrepancies between scholars of the same time period. The fact that he so painstakingly created these margin notes and commentary to only have them thrown out and disregarded is something that perhaps is more common place than not. 




Should we believe that perhaps other scholars provided better recreations of the classics? For example, Erasmus or Montaigne, both scholars of Humanism. The idea that these scholars profited off of their rendition of the literature is something else that is intriguing. Selling not only the original, but your own original thoughts as well.
