Yes, the two applications are different but overlapping. The emblem form stimulated several different uses beyond Alciati's original one of learned entertainment, but the puzzle is at the core of all of them. The reader may enjoy solving the puzzle, may learn skills from the process in or outside a classroom, or may use the emblem for private meditation. Some collections had one or the other of these for a starting point, but most emblems are suitable for all three uses.
