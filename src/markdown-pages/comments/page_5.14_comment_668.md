Thanks for this great info, Kev. My guess is that the logic of selling by the dozen is that teachers (in the case of grammars) and priests or confraternities (in the case of devotional works) were distributing these slight pieces to groups of potential readers. In the case of the grammars, this would ensure that the students in a given class would all have the same text in front of them and would relieve the parents of finding the item in a shop.
