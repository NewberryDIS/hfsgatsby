Marginalia are common in medieval books and in printed books from the start. The notion that you should NOT write in a book is relatively modern. Interestingly, however, relatively few emblem books that I have seen get annotations--perhaps because they tend to be smallish volumes with fairly crowded pages already, and maybe because the beauty of the design discouraged people.
