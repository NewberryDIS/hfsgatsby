The essence of the emblem is that it is a puzzle, so in the first instance there is rarely a key or solution. Alciati originally didn't even give a picture, just the poerm. As the genre evolved, however, some of the more popular collections were issued in annotated editions where there would be a commentary on each emblem that would solve the puzzle or at least explicate the several dimensions of it.
