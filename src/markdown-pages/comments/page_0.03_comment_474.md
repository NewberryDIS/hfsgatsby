For Latin schoolbooks, which is my primary subject in this section, there are several terms (like "rudimenta," which I mention here, or "manuale") that should indicate elementary texts, but they simply aren't used regularly, especially early on. This specific kind of description of intended audience is usually included later on in the title or in a preface or introduction where it will specify "for boys" or "for young people." I discuss this further in chapter six, at 6.07 and 6.19
