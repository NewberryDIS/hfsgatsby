I really enjoyed this book! Many things I didn't know, several good leads for furthering my research, and it's always fascinating to see that textbook companies and the individuals that run them are following centuries-old patterns. In my field (visual arts) there has often been criticism of government censorship of the arts. At least as heavy a censorship, although much more subtly imposed, has been the bottom line of textbook publishing-- what plates cost, which images are already licensed to profitable companies-- all of this has much to do with what is easy or difficult to teach, and therefore what is taught. The internet is changing this somewhat, as it now is for book publishing in general. Go Gehl!
