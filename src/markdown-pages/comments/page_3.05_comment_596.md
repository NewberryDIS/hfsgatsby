The most important thing to keep in mind here is that the "printing revolution" was not like a political upheaval. We think of it as revolutionary because it did in fact change the world; but it happened slowly everywhere and at different speeds in different places. Gutenberg first printed around 1450; Italians only got the technology in the late 1460s, and it did not really transform classrooms for another generation after that. Mancinelli offers a good study because he was an early adopter. And because he is attested as such. Many teachers probably experimented with print in a similar way, but their little textbooks do not survive to tell us about it.
