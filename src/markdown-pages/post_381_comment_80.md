You might want to add Giovambattista Palatino's "Libro nuove d'imparare a scrivere tute sorte lettere" (Rome, 1540) to this category. In it, Palatino includes both an author's portrait on the title page and an emblem on the last page. The emblem of a moth in a candle flame with a motto taken from Petrarch: "Et so ben ch'io vo dietro a quel che m'arde" does not seem to relate to the book but perhaps the author's personality.
