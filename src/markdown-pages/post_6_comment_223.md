I tried posting this comment in the body of the text, but it was not working. This is probably a mistake on my end. What strikes me about "Humanism for Sale" is that the scholarship seems to speak to the concerns of Christopher S. Celenza. His 2004 work "The Lost Italian Renaissance" expresses the dire need for scholars to study the Latin texts of Renaissance authors for a broader understanding of the time period. He also urges researchers to take the time for the thankless duty of translating these texts to encourage further graduate study, especially in the United States. "Humanism for Sale," though focusing on a specific set of writings, is a step in the direction Celenza envisions for Renaissance Studies. Is this a fair assessment?
