I couldn't agree more about the footnotes -- it's hard to chase them by scrolling up and down, so would be great to be able to find the right footnote directly from the text. I also agree with Diana Robin, though -- I find the footnotes and "Next section" links are placed so as to interrupt the flow of the chapter from section to section.
