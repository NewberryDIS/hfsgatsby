Humanism For Sale online is a project of the Newberry Library Center for Renaissance Studies; I owe profound thanks to its staff both present and past. The Newberry's IT and Photoduplication departments have also been essential to its success. Actually getting the book up online was the labor of Rob Carlson, until recently the Web Development Manager of the American Library Association. ALA granted Rob a sabbatical in fall of 2008 to undertake this and other volunteer projects. I am deeply grateful to Rob's colleagues there and to the broadly enlightened policies of that important professional association.

The research for this project began with a fellowship from Harvard University's Center for Renaissance Studies at Villa I Tatti, for which I am also very grateful.
Thanks are also due to many other individuals who have helped with this project. I think of my gratitude in large and overlapping categories, as below. Individuals appear here in only one category, but I trust that many will know they have helped in more than one way. No such list can ever be exhaustive. There are just too many people out there who help without even knowing it.

Many, many other librarians and archivists along the way.
