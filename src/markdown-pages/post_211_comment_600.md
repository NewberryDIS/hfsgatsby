When discussing "a private tutor's classroom," are you also discussing the more elite class? If so, does class play a role in how and why these textbooks were used? For example, Montaigne pushed for a distancing from typical copying of manuscripts and instead encouraged exploration and deep reflection. In this case, would upper-class education add to the growing need for textbooks for exploratory purposes, or perhaps avoid textbook copies altogether?
