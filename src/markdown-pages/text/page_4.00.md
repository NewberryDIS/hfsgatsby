Northern European authors had varying success in penetrating the Italian market. This chapter first discusses the way several highly influential Latin grammar textbooks by Jan de Spauter (ca. 1460-1520), Josse Bade Ascensius (1463-1535), and Jean Pellisson (ca. 150-1567) were redesigned and repackaged for the Italian market. By way of parallel, the chapter concludes by comparing the publishing history of the most popular geography textbooks authored in the North, which also got new packages in Italy.
