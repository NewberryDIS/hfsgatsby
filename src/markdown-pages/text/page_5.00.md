This chapter offers another case study, of the Latin grammar of Manuel Alvares, S.J. (1526-1583). This book appeared in both student and teacher's editions. Commissioned by the Jesuit order, it became the best selling Latin textbook of the early modern age, remaining in print into the late nineteenth century.
