Re: 2.11 visual example &amp; 0.08 visual example:


New images at 2.11 seem but typical little boy pictures with totally innocent yet the typical delusions of grandeur. There is not much more than that. The availability of the writing surface seemed to be irresistible to the youngster for his own purposes and there are not enough meaningful scribbles for my taste.

Contrast 2.11 with the magnificent singleton 0.08, which seems somehow much more deliberate and from a more earnest or studious school boy. A creation. The boxes and lists of numbers/letters decry (or disguise) the one/two innocent little boy scribbles of dangling paraphernalia. An entire blank stimulated a real image to my eye and I find it much more interesting. 

Just think when we were in school and caught writing in our books!! Off with our heads! Oh my fur and whiskers!!
