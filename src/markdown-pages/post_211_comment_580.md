I find this statement about the availability of tutoring positions and Mancinelli's apparent refusal to accept them telling about the philosophy of a humanist at the time, especially since tutoring jobs were "highly desired well into the sixteenth century." Knowing what we know about humanism during the Renaissance, there could be several reasons why he would refuse such a position. One could be that Mancinelli was solely interested in educating as many students as possible, even if that meant refusing the benefits that came with "personal, noble patronage." Similarly, it seems to me that humanists would advocate a sort of "mass education" or public education that did not rely on social class (perhaps with the exception of Montaigne). Mancinelli's decision may very well have been working toward this ideal of education for all, which had now been made possible by the advent of printing.
