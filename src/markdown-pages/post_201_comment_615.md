Hi, Elizabeth. You see the tension correctly , I think, but there is another dimension too that is harder for us to recreate because it does not count for as much in our world as in Mancinelli's. In his day, the intellectual would have automatically distinguished himself from a manual worker. Printing was hard, dirty work that merely reproduced on paper the difficult, creative and largely mental labor of the scholar.
