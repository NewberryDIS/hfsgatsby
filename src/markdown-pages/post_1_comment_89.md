Two further general comments:


1- Perhaps this has already been addressed by others, but the illustrations seem to have morphed over the course of the chapters from the somewhat less desirable (in my opinion) enlargements which occasionally make the original image smaller as they show it in its context (I think I had noted this at 1.07 par 2) to later images that I could see in detail (such as 6.03). I can see where others might prefer the whole book view however. Can you provide both?

2-I enjoyed the tone of the book, especially where the inevitable wrangling among scholars had broken out.
