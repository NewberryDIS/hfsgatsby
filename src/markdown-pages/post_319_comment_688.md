Thanks for these notes, Mr. Newman. The software was off the shelf, so we didn't have too much opportunity to customize it, but your notes on the format are useful as we look towards a re-thinking of the site next year. The long contents column seemed like a neat idea when we mounted the site (ten years ago, so it's really ancient in software terms), but a contents tab is built into the new versions of this software, and will certainly be part of any new format.
