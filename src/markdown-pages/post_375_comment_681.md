An important new collection of essays on printer's marks is: Anja Wolkenhauer, and Bernhard F. Scholtz, eds. <em>Typographorum Emblemata. The Printer's Mark in the Context of Early Modern Culture</em>, Berlin and Boston, Walter de Gruyter, 2018. I will cite this volume repeatedly in the comments that follow in this chapter, using the shorthand <em>Typographorum Emblemata</em> and page numbers.
