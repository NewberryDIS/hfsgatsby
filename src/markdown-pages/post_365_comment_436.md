Yes, as you note, devices on title pages preceded the formal emblem. However, the two title pages you point to in the last chapter are different from each other, and might be worth looking back at, since they may explicate the form. The title page in 6.18 has a true emblem (pictorial object with motto --actually two mottoes-- that complement the picture without solving the puzzle). The title page in 6.19, by contrast, is a narrative scene, the Annunciation to the Virgin, without motto or any particular puzzle dimension.
