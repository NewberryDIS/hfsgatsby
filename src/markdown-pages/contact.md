Your thoughts about Humanism For Sale are welcome. When the blog was still live, you could  use the comment feature, which allowed you to make a note beside any portion of the text that catches your eye, raises a question, or suggests an alternative opinion.  

Now that the comment feature has been disabled, I still welcome your thoughts by e-mail (gehlp@newberry.org) and will respond promptly if I can. 

Thanks in advance for your feedback,
Paul Gehl
