"œI make exception as well for the little book which is entitled Cato. Valla says that its author is the most latinate among the minor authors and that no one in a thousand years has written a more elegant poem. ... And yet perhaps this little book is called Cato from seriousness of behavior and integrity of life, features for which the Catos were very greatly renowned."

I believe the Catones refers not to books, but to the the Elder and Younger Cato; cp. Juvenal 2.40: "œtertius a caelo cecidit Cato ...."
