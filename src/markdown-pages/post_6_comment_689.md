Thanks for your input, Mr. Kinsky. Newer versions of the software move the comments and the contents to separate screens, which is a more contemporary (and now more familiar) way of navigating linked info of the sort. But when we tried to move the content to the new software earlier this year, we lost all the comments, so we have gone back to what we had, at least for the moment. Your endorsement of the robust comment feature in general is important to our thinking going forward, since most of the software out there now assumes readers will make pretty brief (and perhaps emotional) notes rather than thoughtful comments, additions of information, or questions posed to the author/editors.
