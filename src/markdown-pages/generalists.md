*Generalist readers* and *scholars in other fields* who want to know more about the Renaissance and the way people were educated then, how they read, and what publishing and marketing was like can find interesting material here.

You may wish to start with the [Abstract](/abs) or [Table of Contents](/text/000) and click through to other parts of the text using the links there. You can also browse a list of [Major Authors](/mja) treated at length.

But this is way too cumbersome! I want to do better and invite your input on how to do so. I provide a [Quick Summary](/qs) with a list of major themes and links.
