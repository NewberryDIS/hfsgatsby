Like many useful grammars, the Donatus melior did get occasional printings long after it would seem to have been outdated. Guglielmo Facciotti printed it as late as 1628 in Rome along with a matching edition of the Regulae constructionis. See Massimo Ceresa, Una stamperia nella Roma del primo Seicento : annali tipografici di Guglielmo Facciotti ed eredi, 1592-1640, Rome, Bulzoni, 2000, p. 220 for a description of the copies at the Vallicelliana library in Rome.
