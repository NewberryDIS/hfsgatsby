I did not say anything about the colored border in the text here, but I should perhaps remark that it is not part of Soardi's original design. This copy at the Newberry Library has touches of green on many of the borders, probably added by an early reader --maybe even a bookseller--who wanted to add to the charm of Soardi's original.
