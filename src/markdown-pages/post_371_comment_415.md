After not only encouraging "activist" thinking but also translating to regional vernaculars, to what extent did these expand the open-mind syndrome of readers experiencing the importance of personal opinion, interpretation, and perhaps then critical analysis of systems beyond that of the emblem? Or is it just that the emblems really were providing affective lessons of newly revisited morals that effectively left the reader with a new sense of reverence for the system as it was? Mostly, I am curious as to whether there were any popular exceptions?
