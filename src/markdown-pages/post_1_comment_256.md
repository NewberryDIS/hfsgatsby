This book is wonderfully rich throughout. I like having the images right with the text, and in such high quality that one can see a lot by enlarging them. How many printed books have plates that are remotely this informative or beautiful?



Sometimes I lost the thread from section to section when reading chapters on-screen. When I printed out some chapters in toto and read them the old-fashioned way, on paper, the problem vanished. Perhaps I'm just not a good reader of computer screens (are our students better at it, I wonder?).

Is there any way to make the footnote markers "live" so that one can click on them to gain access and return to the same place in the text? I ended up consulting far fewer of them as I read than I normally would do. Also, since the citations in the notes are overwhelmingly in short form, a live link to the bibliography would help immensely. Eventually I figured out I just needed to download the .pdf of the bibliography and keep it open on the side of the screen.



Thanks, Paul, for putting your book online! This is a great resource to which I'll return again and again.
