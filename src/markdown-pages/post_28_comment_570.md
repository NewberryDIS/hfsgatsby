I don't know why it occurs to me to reply only now (five years after Dan's thoughtful comment) -- maybe I am just being deliberate, as admonished by the source texts here. I think he is right in pointing to manners as the immediate dimension of morality that classroom subjects address. But I think that ancient, medieval, and Renaissance thinkers generally saw morality as a continuum that ran uninterruptedly from table manners to moral decision making. Moreover, this continuum or spectrum of behaviors crossed through language learning, thus the power of Latin study to inculcate good habits along the way and the importance of good manners of all sorts to the orderly learning of language.
