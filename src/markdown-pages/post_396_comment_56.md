Re .03. I think it is much too sweeping a generalization to say that a hallmark of






humanist thought was the use of 

commonplaces. A hallmark of 

humanist pedagogy yes. But of 

humanist thought, no. To say this

would be to suggest that humanism

(the rediscovery, cultivation, and 

preservation of the once lost thought

and literature of Greece and Rome) 

itself consisted in, or could be

boiled down into, slogans.
