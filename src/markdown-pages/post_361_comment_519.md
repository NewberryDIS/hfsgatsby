Dear Paul,






I just wanted to let you know I had a nice time using this chapter in my MA level grad course on the Medieval and Early Modern periods. The students responded quite positively to your book and had a lot of interesting things to say in regards to the issues you raise. Like last time, I am using your text to help prepare students for a session in our rare books library with a variety of emblem books from the 16th and 17th centuries. 



Thanks again for this excellent resource! 



Best, Sean Franzel
