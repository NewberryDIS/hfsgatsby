In Chapter 5, you discuss conservativism with regard to Jesuit education. You say "œ Educational conservatism sometimes consists of such inertia. Teachers and (just as often) parents want the children of today to learn the same lessons in the same ways that their elders had. Attachments to textbooks, especially books that were widely memorized, often took this form -- affection reinforced by inertia."(5.07). This, and the sections that followed raised some questions for me. Is there any indication that parents challenged the centralization of Education that was part of the Jesuit program? The chapter emphasizes this combination of issues: localism, conservativism and education, which is interesting because my immediate assumption is that they indicate a demand for cultural autonomy (rather than just the cultural sensitivity that was the cause of localized printing). Would you say that people in general were reacting to the centralization of education in a way that advocated local control?
