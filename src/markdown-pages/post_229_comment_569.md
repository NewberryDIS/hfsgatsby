Lazzari and Lozzi's argument offers a good example of the risks we run if we consider short literary forms like epigrams trivial, occasional, or frivolous works without useful value as historical evidence. True, they are minor forms, but especially in sizable collections like Mancinelli's they offer valuable biographical data and cultural context.
