Very suggestive formulation: emblem "participating in retrospective or reflexive design process;" again, as a non-specialist, I find myself thinking about what this might mean in different medial contexts. In a sense, it seems that these early print forms might help readers appreciate or model new design ideas in ways that are closer to the technologies of the print shop than today (we don't think about writing code when we change our facebook status- are we more alienated from the means of medial production? if we are, should we even care?). On the other hand, participating in a medial environment always seems to involve a certain potential for rethinking, reworking, "redesigning" that environment. Your discussion of the emblem makes this very clear.
