Your point about the relation between text, the author, and moral character is intriguing and essential to the study of humanism. This triadic relation shows to what extent humanists tried to produce perfected works. This idealistic view places a lot of pressure on the humanist individual. It seems somewhat ironic because literature at this time was supposed to be a source of free thinking and an outlet for thinkers to come and express views that were opposing the Church. Relating Christian moral values to such works seems contrary to the goal of humanism: to focus on how aspects such as intelligence and nature influences the individual as opposed to how God influences the individual.
