It's certainly very interesting to learn about the art of memory in this indirect mannor. From the beginning of the chapter I was wondering when the use of emblems would tie in with one's memory. Also, it's interesting to learn that the use of bizzare images did not entirely disappear once the Christian moral way of life took over.
