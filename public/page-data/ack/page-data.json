The Newberry's IT and Photoduplication departments have also been essential to its success. Actually getting the book up online was the labor of Rob Carlson, until recently the Web Development Manager of the American Library Association. ALA granted Rob a sabbatical in fall of 2008 to undertake this and other volunteer projects. I am deeply grateful to Rob's colleagues there and to the broadly enlightened policies of that important professional association.</p>\n<p>The research for this project began with a fellowship from Harvard University's Center for Renaissance Studies at Villa I Tatti, for which I am also very grateful.\nThanks are also due to many other individuals who have helped with this project. I think of my gratitude in large and overlapping categories, as below. Individuals appear here in only one category, but I trust that many will know they have helped in more than one way. No such list can ever be exhaustive. There are just too many people out there who help without even knowing it.</p>\n<p>Research help, both specific and general: Luigi Balsamo, Piero Bellettini, Christian Coppens, Mark Crane, Susan Fagan, Alison Knowles Frazier, Juri Meda, Paola Monacchi, Angela Nuovo, Patricia Osmond, Maria Grazia Nico Ottaviani, Daria Perocco, Silvia Rizzo, Ennio Sandal, Joel Sartorius, Elissa Weaver, Michael Wyatt.
