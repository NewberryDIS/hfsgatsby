It was simple to navigate, and it felt like anyone could use this book. I enjoyed the insertion of art, and real life versions of the texts being talked about. Being able to see and read from the actual texts, instead of reading stand alone quotations really kept me engaged throughout the chapter. I also quite enjoyed the link to the bibliography at the end of every page. Making that information more readily available made for a smooth read. The website itself looks dated and having the contents on the open side seems like a good idea, but it tends to drag pages on longer then they should creating a lot of empty space. Having a contents tab that could be opened at any time rather than having it always on the screen would certainly help alleviate some of the issues. Overall though I think the simple and smooth format that attempts to make as much information as possible immediately available to its reader is well done, and shows off what an e-book can be when it is not trying to stretch itself beyond its limits in attempting to improve upon the book.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4ab8f648-056a-530d-9fb4-e6695ffb8fd5"}},
