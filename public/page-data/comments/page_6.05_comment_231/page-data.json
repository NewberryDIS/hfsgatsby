In the previous section I wondered if particular cities could be the basis for legitimacy. Here I see that Sfortunati cast himself as an experienced teacher and a native speaker of Tuscan, highlighting the importance of vernacular. I get the sense that there is much less argument between competitors over content in the case of math than over method--whereas content was a major concern for those marketing/selling Latin grammar (even as method was also a key issue).</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"bdc7da01-de09-5b21-824a-3c30d782ebce"}},
