I tried to set the scene for this in the introduction (especially sections 0.3 to 0.6). To your specific point here, however --yes, it is important to stress both that textbooks offer only a limited view of pedagogy and that pedagogy is not the whole of humanism. I do belong to the school that sees humanism as first and foremost an educational reform movement and only secondarily a literary and philosophical one.
