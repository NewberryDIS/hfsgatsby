Note, however, that the title page shown here does not name a printer. None is named elsewhere in the book either, suggesting that this first edition was subsidized by the author or his friends and patrons and was not a commercial product. Compare this purely typographic title page, which though wordy is relatively uncluttered, with that of the 1558 Valgrisi edition below where the same advertising prose must be compacted to make way for the prominent commercial printer's mark of Valgrisi.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a34bf425-6fe1-51db-9d7b-db7c6f6dd2df"}},
