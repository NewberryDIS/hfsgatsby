In fact, the interplay of base text, commentary by several critics across nine or ten centuries, and illustrations in the new technology of print is exactly the kind of cumulative, collaborative scholarship we are hoping to promote. It already exists informally within circles of colleagues and friends, but putting it online changes the dynamic for the better and offers a (perhaps utopian) opportunity to enlarge the conversation still further.</p>\n<p>I do think, however, that it is worth trying to figure out what is NOT staying the same. For me, the highly structured Renaissance page offers a hierarchy of authority that is not congenial today. Exactly because there are specialists out there who know more about a specific text than I do, my research report is open to question and correction. And because a number of artists and designers have made notes too, I have acquired new eyes for the beauty or interest of things that looked ordinary or even banal before.</p>\n<p>Again, these comment fields let me add notes on things I am observing anew. For example, in this page the type in this detail from a title page seems to sag. This irregular effect sometimes actually occurs in early printing, but here it is an illusion caused by the way the photo was cropped to show just the text. In the fuller image given at 0.07, you can make out clearly that it is caused by the fact that the page would not lay flat for the photographer. For both conservation and aesthetic reasons, I prefer to have the bowing of the page shown, but just here it may cause some viewers to judge the facts of the printing wrongly.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f2ed1004-d093-5942-a9d6-d47819a08fe2"}},
