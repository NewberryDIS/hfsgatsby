I wonder if it was more beneficial to students in the Renaissance to recieve their education from teachers and regionalized texts rather than from mass printed materials. I agree that the classroom \"affords us a window on groups of readers, but does not always give us a clear view.\" This statement could not be truer as we face standardized testing efforts based on mass produced generalized text books which are used in classrooms. Students struggle to comprehend material and 'keep up' yet don't actually learn and it is evident on their tests and in their interactions with one another in and out of the classroom. It does not really surprise me that students do not choose to expand their horizons by exploring older considerably more difficult texts of old.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"21828293-b8df-5621-aba8-58fc5db62068"}},
