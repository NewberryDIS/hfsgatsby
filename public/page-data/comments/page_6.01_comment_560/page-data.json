Before printing (and therefore before the marketing impulse was strong), there is a regular distinction between those who read (Latin) and those who are illiterate. It appears especially in prefaces to translations of Latin works into vernaculars in the manuscript period, where the reader is addressed sometimes fairly personally. It seems to me to take on new meaning in the \"how-to\" period we encounter several times in Humanism For Sale, e.g. at 4.14 and 4.18 above, and below at 6.11, where it is clearly a marketing tool.
