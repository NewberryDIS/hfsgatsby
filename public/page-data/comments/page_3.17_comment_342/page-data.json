Presumably, Mancinelli felt this to be normal because of his experiences correcting manuscripts, and in his own role as editor and commentator on the works of other, especially ancient, authors. However, I begin to wonder about the need for what seems to me to be an excessive amount of corrections and commentaries by publishers in the printed works of Mancinelli. Is this attitude towards printed grammar books and their constant need for correction an offshoot of manuscript culture, where corrections were commonplace and, presumably, more needed? Or were these corrections and comments simply a way of advertising reprinted editions of the texts in order to make more money?</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"64bab69d-2fde-50c5-b4bd-686338e6e267"}},
