It does not have an exact equivalent in the sixteenth century, but it helps us understand the elitism of the Latin school curriculum. Italians of the period had a clear sense that the full-dress Latin course was most appropriate for boys of the political classes. Correspondingly, they knew that most boys and women did not have access to this course except through the charity or good will of some educators. The interesting thing about the prefaces to the self-study books that appear in the 1520s is that their authors both recognize this opportunity gap and set out to remedy it by selling their new books to this under-served group. This kind of sales pitch is perennial for self-help books --look at Amazon any day!-- but it is still a novelty at this period.</p>\n<p>Your reference to Marxism, Eric, raises a slightly different question too, namely, does the awareness of class differences necessarily imply tension or conflict between the two groups? Although many of the voices we can hear in the period deny such tension --they tend to see class differences as inevitable and to respond in terms of the obligation to Christian charity-- there is also plenty of explicit evidence that the rulers felt there was social tension and that a degree of social mobility through education was one way of relieving it.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f1b7b319-31d2-563f-9f8b-10a231f9be8f"}},
