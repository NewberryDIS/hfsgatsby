The ancient Greeks had the same worry, or claimed to, about writing itself. And of course, educational alarmists now claim that digital media are ruining the abilities of young people to think and read reflectively. The difference is that now we have neurological instruments that let us measure such things. We will know (to some degree) about how present day young people differ from their elders and even more about the next generation; what we do not know is how the earlier technologies changed ancient or early modern brains.</p>\n<p>Regulation in the Renaissance was --to our eyes-- unimaginably inefficient. Local governments could keep surveillance on and regulate local trade, but there were no systems to extend that control very far. Printing eventually spawned many attempts at press regulation and censorship, but, as Luther's case demonstrates, it was not at all effective in the fifteenth and early sixteenth century; and even later, you just had to go to the next town with a willing printer to get something into print. Control of the market for school books was more effective in the sense that teachers had to approve what was used, but there was a lot of competition.
