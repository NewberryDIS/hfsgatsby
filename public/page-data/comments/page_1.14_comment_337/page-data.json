But would young students also own copies of Terence with at least some apparatus, or would they use copies without much/any apparatus and make annotations themselves? In reading about all these editions, I keep comparing them to the appearance of the chaste manuscript version of chapter 1.05. But even in manuscript, you mentioned that there were plenty of commentaries and annotations. Do we find manuscript copies of Terence where the commentaries crowd out the text, or were they normally copied separately, and perhaps bound together? You also mentioned that the de Gouveia commentary was printed separately- how frequently were commentaries printed separately (and perhaps bound with another copy of Terence)? Do you think that teachers became increasingly reliant on commentaries in their teaching, compared with the 15th century, or did they just have more choices? Thanks!</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8c6e0f9e-45ea-5493-b1f3-6577493aed3b"}},
