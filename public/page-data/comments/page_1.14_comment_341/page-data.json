The hyper-extended commentaries we see in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries are definitely a creation of the market for print. Some heavily commented texts existed in the Middle Ages, but they were reference copies owned by teachers, scholars, or libraries and usually confected exclusively for local use. Students most often took down the text and whatever notes they needed by dictation. The separate commentaries by humanists were intended for advanced study; I have never seen one bound with a base text, but that may just be because I have not been looking for them. As to the degree of dependence on commentaries, that is hard to say.

But what we know of teaching in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance suggests that was always true.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e665ec4f-3985-5c5b-a322-2d4fc3e9f08d"}},
