Ceresa also prints an inventory of the Faccioti estate made in 1634 after the death of Faccioti's widow, Maria Zanetti, in which are recorded 244 <em>Grammatiche Emanuelle</em> that \"ha fatto stampare la Signora Maria\" in the months after Facciotti's death in late 1632. It does not appear as of this writing in the Italian national union catalog (SBN). The Mazarine Library in Paris, however, does record a 1631 edition printed by Facciotti, so there may be other seventeenth-century editions by him as yet unrecorded. Certainly it would make sense for him to have kept it in print and for his widow to anticipate an ongoing market.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c4a29ba7-bc93-5bf3-b8d0-94efb22bb4b1"}},
