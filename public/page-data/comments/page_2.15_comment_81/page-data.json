I do not know the work of Baldsuhn (whose name seems to be misspelled in note 91), but most scholars understand Avianus to have been part of the Sex Auctores, the curricular compilation popular in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The Auctores octo, mentioned here, largely displaced the Sex Auctores in the thriteenth century and remained popular for centuries, appearing in at least 50 printings in five countries before 1500; its fable collection is the one commonly attributed to Gualterus Anglicus, whose introductory epistle, written in the voice of the emperor Romulus, credits the fables to Aesop, not Avianus. I have seen many, many printed versions of the Auctores octo, and they all include this collection, not the one attributed to Avianus. See Ronald E. Pepin's translation of the Auctores octo for further information.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e90a1107-4a50-5ebf-8d9d-d6a646454cfb"}},
