So Americans need translations, while we can assume the philological training in Italy and Germany will continue to flourish, and those scholarly publics will not need translations. No doubt this opinion of Celenza's derives from the practical experience of his own teaching. I guess, since I live in a research library world, I am more optimistic about Americans reading Latin. Still, these Latin works (not necessarily the schoolbooks I spend time with, but certainly the dialogues and poetry and treatises that constitute the original works of humanists) deserve to be better known. Fortunately, we have good translations (with Latin on facing pages) coming out regularly now from the Harvard I Tatti series, one of the most exciting initiatives or recent years\nTo punt the question back to you, Mike: Do you think we need more and better Latin training, or more and better translations? You (not I) are the future of Renaissance studies, so it is really the students in your class who must answer this question.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4cebe94b-2325-58f9-a1f8-42f00cab490f"}},
