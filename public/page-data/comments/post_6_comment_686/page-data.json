The ability to move between sections easily is really helpful for referencing material in other parts of the book. Also, the integration of images with zoom-in capability allows the reader to better understand each textual example. I really like that other scholars and readers can comment on specific sets of information, ideally to enhance the book by bringing in new insights. The organization into chapter sub-divisions does pose some issues for me because the chapters seem overly-fragmented and disconnected. The comment section on each page also seems a bit too large, pushing the text too far to one side. I do think this original type of format has the potential to spread, especially with the ability to jump between various sections and images. The vast majority of e-books do not have such accessible images. The book, however, could benefit from less sub-divisions and more prominent text. I understand this is a difficult balance to achieve.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"25a9cec1-36f8-5a38-b2ee-eea6d20bba81"}},
