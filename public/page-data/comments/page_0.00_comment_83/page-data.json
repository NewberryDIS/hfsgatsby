While I agree that it's quite hard to read a scholarly text like this on a computer screen generally (eye strain, internet issues, clunky computer, etc), I think the text might be easier to read if it were possible to spread it out across the screen in two broad columns (like the \"book\" reading function in MS Word), rather than having all of the text squashed to one side while the comments and the contents fields occupy two-thirds of the screen. I'm not suggesting that comments and contents fields disappear -- it's lovely to be able to see them alongside the text -- but perhaps the contents at least could be arranged horizontally at the top of the screen? Just an idea. I was also wondering if there's a way to flag or annotate pieces of text for my own personal use to come back to next time I log in to carry on reading -- ? Ironically enough, I do feel strangely \"lost\" in the text -- despite the helpfully descriptive contents, I really miss being able to flip through the pages to get a better idea. Perhaps it just takes a little more getting used to (I've only been navigating the site for about a week).</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"138a931a-7144-5794-b613-1576e1d2c84c"}},
