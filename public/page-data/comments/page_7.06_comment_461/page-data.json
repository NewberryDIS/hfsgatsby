It would be a way of making a personal mark like an author's title page emblem, but also a memory technique\"”a handwritten note beside an emblem might represent a larger idea or conclusion. This practice is so common in the present, I can hardly imagine reading a textbook without highlighting or writing questions and ideas in the margin. Were these books too valuable to be scribbled in? Or did the advent of printing and resulting ease of text production render them less precious? Or was the idea of writing in a book not so problematic in the first place\"”I remember learning that many surviving medieval personal books of devotion, painstakingly composed by scribes, are rife with the handwritten notes of their various owners. I'm curious how ideas of ownership and personalization played out in this new type of text.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"dac4e6ae-4fc0-59bd-8ba8-7ff9fad4e8c6"}},
