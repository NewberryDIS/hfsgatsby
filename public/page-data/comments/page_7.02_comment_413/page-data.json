I am curious as to the extent of the \"universalness\" of this type of thinking, and specifically of its application. Were there many amateurs creating their own emblems? How many children learning this thinking and \"devising\" of emblems apply their knowledge and in how many related ways outside of merely creating more emblem books, and were they exposed at higher levels of education as well or only as a member of the general public? Also, how cooperative versus authoritative was the writer-artist production of emblems, and out of curiosity were any writers also artists?</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ca75e0de-c45b-5de3-a354-bca367b7dcfe"}},
