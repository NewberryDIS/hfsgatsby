It is an unresponsive layout rather than responsive. Meaning no matter the size of the browser window the content remains the same. This is somewhat of a problem as on my laptop screen the content is to the left takes up only 2/3 of the page, leaving the last right side 1/3 a gray area. This causes the actual page to look odd.</p>\n<p>There are also two \"Table of Content\" sections on the homepage which is unnecessary.</p>\n<p>The website is also not mobile-friendly which makes it difficult for mobile readers. This is a shame because one of the plus-sides of e-books are there portability.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the e-book is also not accessibility-friendly. This website:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wave.webaim.org\">http://wave.webaim.org</a></p>\n<p>is a useful tool showing what improvements can be made to make websites accessibility friendly.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2ba7f53e-967f-5fd4-8c2d-675e2b6ac355"}},
