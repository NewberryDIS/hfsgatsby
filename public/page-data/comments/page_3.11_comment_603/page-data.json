You bring into question the reliability of Mancinelli. If we compare his works to others like Erasmus or Montaigne, do we see that there is discrepancies among all of them?</p>\n<p>In addition, there is an interesting point brought up about the comments and references made in the margins. The idea that you not only buy the literature for the content of the creator, but for the content provided to you by the scholar. It is truly the 15th century version of \"peer-reviewed\" in a sense. Also, that those comments could be lost in \"translation\" and recreation during printing we bring into question the importance of content versus the method used to diffuse the content. Was printing a clean version more important than the content provided in the first?</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"400e8b7c-2a98-53a8-9815-e545578ff1bf"}},
