Later works (De institutione grammatica libri tres), reverse the design and give precedence to Avares' name as though it were the title. I imagine this was a deliberate marketing decision to lead with the author's name. It makes me think of those paperback novels you might see in line at the grocery store, where the biggest type on the cover is the name of the author (e.g. Danielle Steel). You have to look closely to see the actual title. In cases like Steel, no matter the title, it's the author's name that sells. In the case of Alvares, it is interesting to see that the book began to be called \"Grammatica Emmanuelis,\" and was even titled as such in later editions.</p>\n<p>Before reading these chapters, I had always guessed that Avlares was your typical author-celebrity type\"” wanting to see his name in lights, so to speak. However, the descriptions of him wanting to pass a quiet career as a schoolteacher, his admonitions about boastfulness, and his modesty, make me think it was the Jesuit publishing enterprise that thought to build the Alvares brand the way it did.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a9eb48ba-ff41-5204-bb25-fef62e2abbe4"}},
