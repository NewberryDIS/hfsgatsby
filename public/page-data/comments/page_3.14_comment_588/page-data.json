The relationship of humanism to the church is not an easy one to describe, because there were so many different solutions, almost as many as there were serious thinkers in the period. Mancinelli is writing on the eve of the Reformation, when many intellectuals were dissatisfied with the corruption of the church and their relative inability to effect reforms.

He is very devoutly religious and does not seem to have felt there was any real or necessary break between classical scholarship and Christian orthodoxy. I suspect this was a common stance among humanists, especially those of the second rank.
