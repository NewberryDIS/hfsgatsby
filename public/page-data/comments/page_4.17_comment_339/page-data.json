Also, Italy was the place of refuge for those escaping the fall of Byzantium, as well as a main center of contact \"“ through attempted invasions, trade, and attempts at counter-attack \"“ with the Arab/Ottoman world, having much closer contact than the imperial powers like Spain, Portugal, etc., did. Did this result in Italian humanists drawing more inspiration on the geographic/naturalistic discoveries of the East, even if they ignored the discoveries coming in from the other direction? Or was the knowledge of the Muslim/Eastern world so diffused through Europe at this time that it would have had little impact on Italian humanists specifically?</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3140ee55-8d6b-5971-8851-fda2c2526766"}},
