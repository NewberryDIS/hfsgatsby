You are right to point to the limited interactivity of Humanism For Sale, not so much because of the software but simply because we do not normally interact repeatedly with scholarly monographs. Typically such works get reviews (traditionally in print) and then accumulate a citation history in the relevant scholarly literature. But even scholars in the filed who might comment once on first reading will not comment on later readings, merely cite and go on to something else. By contrast to some e-fiction and music which is intended to grow via additions from an audience, the audience for a monograph is mostly static. Indeed if you quickly scan the HFS comments, only a few have multiple replies. The greatest number of comments, moreover, are my own, intended to bring the discussion up to date with citations of new literature.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7bce26bc-cb78-5a21-96b1-e8419d856894"}},
