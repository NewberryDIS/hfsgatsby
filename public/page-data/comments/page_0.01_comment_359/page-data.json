How did one advertise to large groups of teachers and students in the middle ages? I suppose that's where the \"celebrity\" teachers come in; if they advocate for a certain author or book, then that book or person's reputation would leap upwards.

Or do we only know which books were used based on what still exists today?</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"031d2802-4105-5e34-9c18-9691b137f3b5"}},
