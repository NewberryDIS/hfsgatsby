It is now clear to me that the earliest editions supervised directly by Cantalicio bear both the title <em>Summa perutilis...</em> (on a title or cover page) and <em>Canones grammatices</em> (in the caption tile to the preface supplied by Cantalicio). The usage of canones is interesting, since this word is used in the titles of books in many disciplines (law, canon law and medicine most prominently), but I have not found any other writer on grammar who employs this rather elevated term to describe grammatical rules.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"eac0efe1-8e80-58a2-905f-e547ca9cc75b"}},
