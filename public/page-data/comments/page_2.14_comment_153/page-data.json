I see how the Catones can be read of the two admirable individuals. As Hannah Zdansky noted in her remark at 2.02 above, medieval and humanist authors knew both figures and had a good sense of the reputation of the clan. But as you will have noticed throughout my writing, I am fascinated by the way these personal names are transferred to the books themselves. Do you think Bebel might have intended a double meaning, so that these \"Catones\" are books, constructed in parallel to \"the book called Cato\" as well as contrasted with the two human Catos? Perhaps he would have used \"a quibus\" instead of \"in quibus\" if he meant it to be read the way I translated it?</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"aa796963-06d4-5e23-b9e5-539b4b357969"}},
