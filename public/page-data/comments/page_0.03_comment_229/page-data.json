The ability to mechanically print texts led to standardized testing and teaching to the masses, removing the regionalizing. I think your point that \"the classroom affords us a window on groups of readers\" is still true and although the delivery of texts have become more standardized and consistent the view is still not clear. You state that as students grow intellectually as readers they \"employ these skills with increasing degrees of individualism\", Educators are faced with a decreased level of overall understanding and comprehension of material in and out of the classrooms by the students who stuggle to grow individually in the face of standardized testing and mass production of classroom textbooks. I wonder if it was more beneficial to have students learn from regional texts created by their teachers.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"79a2444f-a949-518d-a769-2a8a2f61776b"}},
