You are right to point to the oddity (from our point of view) in attacking or defending Terence, studied always in Latin, in the vernacular. Keep in mind, however, that this was part of a much larger debate, in which the Giraldi family as a whole was deeply involved, over the nature of poetry. This debate went on largely in Italian, but necessarily involved the value of classical poetic models, Terence being a standard author. So, in a sense, Terence is not the real subject, though we risk anachronism if we discount how passionate sixteenth-century readers could get about beloved classical authors.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3aca5025-6400-52a6-a6a0-13ba6826322c"}},
