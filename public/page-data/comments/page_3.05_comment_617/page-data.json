While bulk printing allowed more students access to education, it also forced students to learn in a specified way that seems to contradict many humanist teachings. You touch on this with your comment that \"speedy learning of this sort is most beneficial to the student who is a quick study\". While Mancinelli claims to be a humanist, it appears that as he becomes more invested in himself and innovating the \"humanist classroom\", he loses sight of the ideals that shape humanistic education.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"727dbbf8-9a0f-54ba-91b9-361ca2304707"}},
