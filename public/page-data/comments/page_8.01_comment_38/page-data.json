(Indeed, when such things go into print, they cease being ineffable.) What's interesting in this Renaissance context, though, is that private ownership of the property is not prized. Commonplaces are \"common\" property whose value lies precisely in their commonness, and the student/teacher/orator establishes his (or her) worth by demonstrating command of the common stock of wisdom (which might be \"ownership\" of a different sort). This whole attitude toward a commonly-held \"intellectual property\" obviously speaks to a different conception of selfhood in the Renaissance, to different conceptions of ownership (one wonders how this might be reflected in legal documents), and (obviously) to different conceptions of the author/artist. I think the whole notion of the wholesaling/retailing of classical culture is very fruitful and provocative.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b6262996-696d-5e77-835c-219ea5678ea9"}},
