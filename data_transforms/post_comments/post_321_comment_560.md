Peter's 17th and 18th-century examples, above, make me think that a real desideratum would be to trace the trope of the non-Latin reader through book history over the long haul. Before printing (and therefore before the marketing impulse was strong), there is a regular distinction between those who read (Latin) and those who are illiterate. It appears especially in prefaces to translations of Latin works into vernaculars in the manuscript period, where the reader is addressed sometimes fairly personally. It seems to me to take on new meaning in the "how-to" period we encounter several times in Humanism For Sale, e.g. at 4.14 and 4.18 above, and below at 6.11, where it is clearly a marketing tool. The key period for this is the 1520s. \n\nPerhaps putting a lot of examples like Peter's from a single large discipline or genre (his are language study works --grammars) would be an instructive data set.
