Hello Mr. Paul Gehl,\n\nI am taking professor Stevens' History of Book class and we were instructed to contact you with comments and/or constructive criticism. \n\nThe first constructive criticism I would like to make is on your website layout. It is an unresponsive layout rather than responsive. Meaning no matter the size of the browser window the content remains the same. This is somewhat of a problem as on my laptop screen the content is to the left takes up only 2/3 of the page, leaving the last right side 1/3 a gray area. This causes the actual page to look odd. \n\nThere are also two "Table of Content" sections on the homepage which is unnecessary. \n\nThe website is also not mobile-friendly which makes it difficult for mobile readers. This is a shame because one of the plus-sides of e-books are there portability. \n\nLastly, the e-book is also not accessibility-friendly. This website:\n\nhttp://wave.webaim.org\n\nis a useful tool showing what improvements can be made to make websites accessibility friendly.
