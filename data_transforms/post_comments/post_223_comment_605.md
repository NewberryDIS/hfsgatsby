You are pointing to a crucial matter of the new economy of print, Hannah, in that a second or subsequent edition of a base text that has been reworked by a new editor or commentator is offering what we would call "added value" on the marketplace. This is new to printing, made possible by the way in which books in sizable editions compete for customers. Just in this case, of scholarly work on Valla, authors like Erasmus and Mancinelli were attempting to profit (whether materially or just in prestige) from a humanist text that had already become a classic. \n\nSeveral of your classmates have pointed to the matter of scholarly controversy and argumentation. This is another case where printing really made a difference, since a given argument could get a very wide audience through print.\n\nAs for "clean" texts, that is important only if the text is authoritative in some way, so the editions of classics got reworked over and over in the search for a better understanding of the original author's language and intent.
