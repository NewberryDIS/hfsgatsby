â€œWhy do you ...â€] perhaps â€œâ€™Hah! That a theologian involves himself in such worthless trifles!â€™ First, I consider that nothing should be an object of disdain that belogs to good letters, much less these verses with such elegance of Latin style and so formative of good character. But why should I be ashamed to invest just a few hours on this kind of literature to which many Greek writers devoted themselves and won considerable praise.â€\n\nnuggets] nugae is commonly used to mean â€œtrifles,â€ â€œidle businessâ€; in literary contexts it is often used in humility conceits (the locus classicus is Catullus 1.4) whereby one refers to oneâ€™s own works as nugae.
