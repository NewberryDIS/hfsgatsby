commenting proverbs] insert on; one can, I think, make a distinction between adagia and proverbs, adagia being, as indicated, â€œsayingsâ€ or â€œvivid expressionsâ€ which may have a moral component, but usually do not (e.g., ouden pros epos [Erasmus, Adagia I v 45: Nihil ad versum] quoted in his dedicatory letter to his ed. of the Disticha, n107), whereas proverbs of the type in Disticha Catonis usually convey an injunction or some advice about good behavior.
