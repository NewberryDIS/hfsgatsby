Thanks, Diana. The only true wisdom resides in careful generalization. I tried to set the scene for this in the introduction (especially sections 0.3 to 0.6). To your specific point here, however --yes, it is important to stress both that textbooks offer only a limited view of pedagogy and that pedagogy is not the whole of humanism. I do belong to the school that sees humanism as first and foremost an educational reform movement and only secondarily a literary and philosophical one. But even beyond that difference of starting point, I hope that <em>Humanism For Sale</em> has shown that one of the most important loci for understanding humanism and the humanists is in the defense of their educational program that printed textbooks embody.
