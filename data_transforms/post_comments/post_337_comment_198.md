Good point. The first comparison, to a barber, has to be referring to a professional, though not one of high social status. But I suppose an amateur might be understood in Arrighi's case, since the context is learning to play an instrument. On the other hand, the writing masters are clearly claiming professionalism and progressively claiming higher degrees of professional status.
