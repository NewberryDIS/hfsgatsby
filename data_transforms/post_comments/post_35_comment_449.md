There is not much literature on Negro, but there is a brief account of his use of the vernacular in Brian Richardson, "Latin and Italian in Contact in Some Renaissance Grammars," in <em>Rethinking Languages in Contact, the Case of Italian</em> (London, Legenda, 2006), 28-42, at 30-31. Richardson also cites an article unknown to me at the time of this writing by Giovanni Mercati, "Pescennio Francesco Negro Veneto," in <em>Ultimi contributi alla stora degli umanisti</em> (Vatican City, 1939).
