Thanks for these two examples, Peter. I think they start to give an answer in their own words. Both of them offer personal histories--apparently pretty singular if not in fact entirely original-- for how difficult it was for the non-Latin literate to study ancient languages. Although both Reeve and Elstob saw immediately how it would help others to have an introductory text in English, they did not recognize that their own experiences were so nearly unique that there was no built-in audience for their books. It is easy for us to underestimate the conservatism of educators in the early modern period. The institutional buyers all wanted textbooks that would fit the existing curriculum, not entirely new ones. \n\nStill, your initial question about marketing rhetoric merits some further thought, for at least Reeve and Elstob specifically devised addresses to non-Latin reading potential users. This practice of imagining a not-very-educated reader/user goes back at least to Tagliente, and there are other examples later in this chapter too --see 6.17 on "poor churchfolk."\n\nI'll hope to come back to this theme with further examples, and maybe some more solutions too.
