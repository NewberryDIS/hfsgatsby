Is there a significant presence of the Blessed Virgin in these emblems? Your title suggests so, but the section focuses on several examples of the children of the first part and merely mentions the BVM as the patron of Jesuit academies. I'd be curious to know if there was some sort of tradition of Marian depictions, as with your discussion of children.
