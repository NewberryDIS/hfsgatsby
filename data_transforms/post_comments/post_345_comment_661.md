The realm of non-Latin, non-elite printing extended to an enormous variety of print products in the vernacular. One important account is that of Rita Salzberg, <em>Ephemeral City, Cheap Print and Urban Culture in Renaissance Venice</em>, Manchester University Press, 2014. There are also some remarks on the retailing of such material in an article I co-authored: Gehl and Kevin M. Stevens, â€œCheap Print: A Look Inside the Lucini/Sirtori Stationery Shop at Milan (1597-1613), <em>La BibliofilÃ­a</em> 112 (2010), 281-327.
