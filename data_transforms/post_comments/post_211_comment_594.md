Most teachers had had some education to humanist ideals and the theories of the humanism were universally accepted in the sixteen-century. Printing, and then the business of publishing came along as a way of popularizing and commercializing education. Even though education was strongly influenced by the Jesuit model and conservatism, this paragraph explained how great deal the widespread diffusion of textbooks had brought some advantages in the traditional way of teaching basic grammar rules to students. The paragraph also emphasizes the issues of incorrectness in the textbooks by limiting the mistakes populated by the manuscripts copies. It also provides students with meaningful older pedagogical principles. It depicts the quickness of the instruction and the curriculum. Most of all, Mancinelli put a stress on how well the publishing opportunity protect the integrity of Latin. My immediate assumption is this idea of the professionalization of teaching and a kind of mercantilism in the humanist way.
