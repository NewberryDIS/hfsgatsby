To take your last point first, Elizabeth, we do not have any good price data on Mancinelli's books (or indeed on most printing of the 15th century). It is clear, however, that the small textbook-type booklets he wrote for students were relatively cheap. As one of your colleagues remarked at section 3.05, however, this meant that he was aiming for a market of citizen schools, not at the education of aristocrats.\n\nAs for the urge to correct, this is common to most scholars, but it was given new possibilities with the invention of printing. Printing meant that many more copies of an erroneous text could circulate, but reprinting meant that there was a new opportunity --fueled by market competition-- to make the texts better in later editions.\n\nYour point about acclaim vs. quailty is something I have thought a lot about. Printing made the manufacture of fame possible in a new way, one that scholars of the period have discussed but not come to final conclusions about.
