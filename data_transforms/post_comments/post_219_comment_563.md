Dugald McLellan, <em>Antonio Mancinelli ad Orvieto</em> cit. at section 3.01, pp. 63-64, assumes correctly that Mancinelli's textbooks would have been available for use in his own classrooms in this period. Alas, we do not have direct evidence of their presence in the trade or any way of knowing which editions were available in which of the towns where he taught.
