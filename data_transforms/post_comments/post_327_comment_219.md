"The preface goes on to claim preeminence in commerce for Florence..."\n\nWas this practice of linking the authority/desirability of the text to a particular city, Florence in this case, a common selling point for math textbooks? If so, did the 'origin' of the text become more important than its author, in terms of marketing strategy?
