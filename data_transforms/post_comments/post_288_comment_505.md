Bingo! You are absolutely right, Peter, about the Jesuit marketing effort and branding --they phrased it in more traditional terms, promoting the use of a book by "one of our own"-- but it is clearly an effort to create a book with a Jesuit identity. In later years it was used sometimes outside the Jesuit schools, but even then it was identified with them and their particular theories of language education. The evolution of the "Grammatica Emmanuelis" label is a bit of a puzzle to me, though it follows a pattern typical in the book trade. I suspect it started largely as a typographical convention, that is, if you are going to specify the author with both his name and surname, "Emmanuelis" is going to take up nearly a line anyway, so it becomes prominent visually more or less by default. When booksellers and buyers looked at the title page and compared it to others, the most prominent word was the easiest shortcut with which to refer to to book, and gradually this became the commonplace way to refer to it in a crowded market for Latin grammars.
