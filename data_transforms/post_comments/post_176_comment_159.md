Dan Sheerin, in a note that appears by mistake on the previous section, remarks of this translation, "utriusque virtutis] We need more context to figure out to what utriusque virtutis, â€œof each virtue/of both virtues,â€ refers.\nUnfortunately, as often happens in early modern books, such phrases appear pretty much without context. The Latin in note 95 is the entire text of the rubric which precedes the Cato in this edition of the Donat and which separates the Pseudo-Donatus rules from the precepts of Pseudo Cato. The sense might be understood as instruction in liberal arts and also every appropriate virtue. The rubricator seems to be struggling to get both grammatical and moral instruction into his brief advertisement for the book.
