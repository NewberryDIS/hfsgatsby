I find it surprising that Alvares' grammar was sent out for international review and it changes my perspective on the Jesuit schools. I always knew the Jesuits were influential and international, but I had not thought much about the economic and educational enterprise behind their endeavors (social and religious enterprise for sure). When I think about sending books out for feedback, collecting and analyzing that feedback, and making decisions with that information, I see that they are more than a collection of schools, but a school systemâ€” perhaps not too unlike what we see today.
