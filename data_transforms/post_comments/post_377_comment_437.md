I found it really interesting to read about how an imprint can actually be self-explaining, when we know the meaning and quality of it. \n\nIt is also interesting how printers' marks are later being used as reputations or symbols and basically sell the book, because the symbol is right on the front on the title page. \n\nI feel like the reader has to sort out, whether the book is a shoddy book or a good book, or rely on other opinions, this is how culture changes.
