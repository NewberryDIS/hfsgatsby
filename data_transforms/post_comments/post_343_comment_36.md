Reading this chapter again, I am struck by the breadth of the vernacular reading curriculum. You do a great job of highlighting the considerable variety of texts (commercial/arithmetic, musical, how-to, religious, etc.) available to readers. I am thinking you could (should!) add a section here, something like "Sanctity in the Classroom." Religious educators such as Carlo Borromeo and Silvio Antoniano (in Milan) considered saint's lives to be important aids in moral instruction in both the catechism and vernacular schools. (see Turchini, 1996). Numerous examples of such inexpensive texts (octavos, 8-32 pp.) survive in Italian libraries. A sustained and extensive study of these booklets could yield interesting information about ownership, usage, and reading habits. Great job, Paul.
