I tried posting this before, but my comment got eaten, so let's try this again...\n\nI wonder if the fact that the earliest voyages to the New World, if not done by Italian states still were done with Italian navigators and innovations, allowed for an early interest in the New World discoveries by Italian humanists, only dying out after the imperial powers developed independence from Italian aid. Also, Italy was the place of refuge for those escaping the fall of Byzantium, as well as a main center of contact â€“ through attempted invasions, trade, and attempts at counter-attack â€“ with the Arab/Ottoman world, having much closer contact than the imperial powers like Spain, Portugal, etc., did. Did this result in Italian humanists drawing more inspiration on the geographic/naturalistic discoveries of the East, even if they ignored the discoveries coming in from the other direction? Or was the knowledge of the Muslim/Eastern world so diffused through Europe at this time that it would have had little impact on Italian humanists specifically?
