Suddenly we reading about geography\nbooks. I missed the connection to \nLatin grammar texts. Did you prepare\nus for this transition earlier? Could you\ngive us perhaps in the introduction to\nthe book a sense of why you\nplanned to include geography other\nthan that such books were also \npublished in Latin?
