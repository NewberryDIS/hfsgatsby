sententiam saepenumero non assequitur] assequitur should be translated â€œattain to,â€ â€œgrasp,â€ or â€œgetâ€\n\nmore idiotic] better â€œmore wanting in eloquence than speechlessness itselfâ€\n\nrhetoricatur] perhaps â€œplays the rhetorâ€; the reference here is surely to Robertus de Evremond who indicates in his dedicatory letter that it is in part a response to a request for instruction in rhetoric.\n\nmore idiotic] perhaps something like â€œless articulate than inarticulateness itselfâ€\n\nphilosophizes ineptly] â€œquite ineptlyâ€ or â€œquite inapproriatelyâ€; this is more likely a reference to the anonymous commentary â€œSummi deus largitor praemiiâ€ than to Philippus de Bergamoâ€™s Speculum regiminis. The anonymus begins with an invocation of protreptic to wisdom and philosophy and soon discusses the in terms of their causa materialis, causa finalis, causa efficiens, and causa formalis; the commentary of Philippus de Bergamo, his Speculum Regiminis, begins, after a dedicatory epistle, with an elaborate inventorium.
