Good conclusion. I like the disavowals\nand qualifications in this concluding\nsection. These modify some of the \nsweeping statements\nyou make earlier which sometimes\nappear to equate textbook\npedagogy and the teaching of\nelementary Latin with Renaissance \nhumanism. Should you make the\ndistinction clearer in your introduction to the book? Just a question.
