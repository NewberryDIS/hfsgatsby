I very much like your conclusion to this\nchapter. It pulls everything together\nso well. In fact the books --\ntextbooks for a number of different \ndisciplines -- you've been talking \nabout do evince a new mentalite:\nan interest, as you say, in self-help\nor how-to manuals and a new valuing\nof the quantitative arts and sciences.\nThe trend, as you note, is toward the\nconquering nature and the\nprivileging of quantification. Have you\nincluded these important conclusions\nin the Intro to the book?
