For those unfamiliar with blogging, this comment is a link to John Vincler's thoughtful and provocative blog about art and books, "Deviant Forms." In addition to some notes on emblems, with specific reference to the title page of Leviathan, at this link, you can find John's musing about a variety of contemporary and historical artistic books.
