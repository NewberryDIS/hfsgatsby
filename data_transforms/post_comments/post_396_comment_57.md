Re.03. The identification of humanism\nand the humanist movement in early\nmodern Europe with elementary\nLatin pedagogy in its commercial \nforms trivializes humanism. Yes, there\nis always a connection between \neducation and its commercial uses\nand value. But, again, a distinction\nneeds to be made between the\nphilosophy of humanism as a world\nview, on the one hand, and one of its\nmost rudimentary components: \ni.e. the teaching of Latin grammar\nand its transmission via little sayings supposely culled from Latin authors.\nYes, elementary Latin grammar was\nsold -- and sold successfully -- as \nyou have shown. But I find\nit confusing and reductive to identify\nhumanism with the teaching of the\nmechanics of one language.
