Re .03. I think it is much too sweeping a generalization to say that a hallmark of\nhumanist thought was the use of \ncommonplaces. A hallmark of \nhumanist pedagogy yes. But of \nhumanist thought, no. To say this\nwould be to suggest that humanism\n(the rediscovery, cultivation, and \npreservation of the once lost thought\nand literature of Greece and Rome) \nitself consisted in, or could be\nboiled down into, slogans.
