This Lyon tradition of publishing Mancinelli continued. Google Books recently put up on line a copy of a Lyon, 1511 edition (with the printer's mark of Jean Huguetan) that is now in the Bavarian State Library. This copy has the intriguing note that it was acquired in 1516 for the monastery of Tegernsee, showing how international the market for such grammar books could be.
