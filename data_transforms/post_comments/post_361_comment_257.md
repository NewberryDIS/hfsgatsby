This was my favorite chapter as well, especially for its deft attention to cognitive aspects of the use of emblems. This could juxtapose interestingly with the work of William B. Ashworth, Jr., e.g., "Natural history and the emblematic world view," in David C. Lindberg and Robert S. Westman (eds.), _Reappraisals of the Scientific Revolution_ (Cambridge, 1990), pp. 303â€“32.
