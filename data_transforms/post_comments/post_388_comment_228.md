Good question, Maureen. Maybe my section title is a little misleading. In fact many Jesuit emblems are about devotion to the Blessed Virgin, but do not include images of the Virgin herself. This is part of the general strategy of emblematics, to create puzzle-pictures, in which the subject is referred to only indirectly. \n\nAlas, the Partenoapean emblem book is very rare and we do not have a copy at the Newberry from which I could give you a concrete example of how the emblems really look. I have used it only on microfilm, and that on loan from a scholar here in Chicago.
