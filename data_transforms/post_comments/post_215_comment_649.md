The intellectual life of humanists in Rome in the 1480s centered around the University and the "academy" led by Pomponio Leto. For grammar at the University see Wouter Brucke, cit. section 0.07 para 7 above, and other essays in the same volume (<em>Roma e lo Studium</em>...). For an intreee to the extensive literature on Leto, see the online Repertorium Pomponianum (http://www.repertoriumpomponianum.it/).
