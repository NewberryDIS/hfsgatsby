Same comment I made about the\nsudden discussion of geography\ntext books. Are we prepared for your\ndiscussion of arithmetic, music and \nother "skills"? Vernacular literacy?\nTextbooks that teach double-entry\naccounting in a book titled\n"Selling Humanism" seems\n incongruous. I'm waiting for you to establish the connection between "humanism"\nand vernacular school subjects.\n(I think the term "humanism" should\nbe defined in your Introduction to the\nbook.)\n "How To Do Stuff" I would drop from\nthe chapter title.
