You point to an interesting question, Dan, one that scholars are still writing about. "Effectively settled" was an overstatement on my part, since in fact the morality of the plays and the ethics of using them continued to be debated until recent times. There is a new article in the March 2008 issue of The International Journal of the Classical Tradition by Peter McG. Brown, that discusses censored versions right up to the 1970s. (See: "The Eunuch Castrated," cit. 16-28.) Caesar, of course, has not of the same moral problems, but little of the lively language either.
