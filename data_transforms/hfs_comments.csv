     Just to add to your argument about the popularity of Bossi's grammar in Milan. I've recently located a stationer's shop from that city (ASM, notarile, 4 March 1613, f. 24498) in which the presence of Bossi is particularly striking. The inventory lists 70 dozen (840 copies) "regole Bosso" with a wholesale price of just under 2 soldi/copy. Alvares' grammar ("emanuel") appears on the list too, but only in 12 copies, each listed at 16 soldi/copy.     \
\
    Also recorded in quantity and variety are donati ("al sena"; "al vocaboli") and the *regola* of Guarino (in one case combined with the donato). Like Bossi's work, these are described as being sold in bundles of 12 (dozzina)** and priced as such. Wholesale prices fall in a narrow range, from 1 soldo for the cheapest donato (printed on 4 1/2 sheets) to just under 3 soldi for a text combining the regola and donato.\
\
   All of this is strong evidence to support your claim of the continuing market for very conservative grammars well into the seventeenth century. \
\
 ** I would like to know why such grammars (as well as thin devotionals and slight works of hagiography) were sold and priced by the dozen. Anyone have any ideas about this?`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; InfoPath.1)`,``,`0`,`12`,`2`,\N

In fact, there will be a curve away from customizability as industrialization increases: the page makeup processes get more specialized, presses become larger and faster, and the distance from man to work increases. Now we have a curve back toward the personalization. But the system is so complex now that teachers still can't customize very well. What most teachers do for customization is photocopying.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.20) Gecko/20081217 Firefox/2.0.0.20`,``,`0`,`13`,`2`,\N

(There's also a competing product called Diigo that I was comparing a couple of months ago.) I think the problem lies not necessarily in the products themselves, but possibly in the fact that works like yours are really already so practically comprehensive and complete that it seems almost a little late for individuals to interact with them.\
 \
If I were to get into this book (actually, I can't wait to delve into the stuff on Erasmus!), I would need to set aside a significant amount of time -- at my desktop computer. But the product is so well constructed already that it actually merits being locked up and printed so that I can read it in a comfortable chair! I also find myself looking for structure, illustrations, and so on, and being disappointed.\
 \
I don't know if it's my old-fashioned "book" mind that craves the staticity and controlled nature of a printed and bound product (would a younger, more postmodern reader prefer this format?) or if there is something objectively qualitative about a "ludic reading" experience (cf. Sven Birkerts) that calls for being away from the depths of the machine and precludes too much interaction.\
 \
Every discussion like this first calls to mind talmudist concentric marginalia and then the joyous "conversation" of scribbling notes in the margins of our own books. Maybe I just need to find more quiet time and space to be able to read these works carefully.

You do a great job of highlighting the considerable variety of texts (commercial/arithmetic, musical, how-to, religious, etc.) available to readers.  I am thinking you could (should!) add a section here, something like "Sanctity in the Classroom." Religious educators such as Carlo Borromeo and Silvio Antoniano (in Milan) considered saint's lives to be important aids in moral instruction in both the catechism and vernacular schools. (see Turchini, 1996). Numerous examples of such inexpensive texts (octavos, 8-32 pp.) survive in Italian libraries.

(Indeed, when such things go into print, they cease being ineffable.) What's interesting in this Renaissance context, though, is that private ownership of the property is not prized. Commonplaces are "common" property whose value lies precisely in their commonness, and the student/teacher/orator establishes his (or her) worth by demonstrating command of the common stock of wisdom (which might be "ownership" of a different sort). This whole attitude toward a commonly-held "intellectual property" obviously speaks to a different conception of selfhood in the Renaissance, to different conceptions of ownership (one wonders how this might be reflected in legal documents), and (obviously) to different conceptions of the author/artist. I think the whole notion of the wholesaling/retailing of classical culture is very fruitful and provocative.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko/2009021910 Firefox/3.0.7`,``,`0`,`14`,`4`,\N

The Auctores octo, mentioned here, largely displaced the Sex Auctores in the thriteenth century and remained popular for centuries, appearing in at least 50 printings in five countries before 1500; its fable collection is the one commonly attributed to Gualterus Anglicus, whose introductory epistle, written in the voice of the emperor Romulus, credits the fables to Aesop, not Avianus. I have seen many, many printed versions of the Auctores octo, and they all include this collection, not the one attributed to Avianus. See Ronald E.

\
I have been fascinated by the evolution of the title page, especially those that take the form of imaginary architectural spaces or cabinets of wonders that graphically attempting to represent or summarize a book's contents.  I find what you have here immensely helpful. I'm thinking of <a href="http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/modernity/images/hobbes2-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">Hobbes's Leviathan</a>  (http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/modernity/images/hobbes2-1.jpg) or of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mauerquadrant.jpg" rel="nofollow">Tycho Brahe's Mural Quadrant</a> (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mauerquadrant.jpg).  \
\
It seems increasingly clear to me, that these two works referenced above from the 17th and late 16th centuries represent a further evolution of the same sort of verbal / visual interplay you describe here, whereas the designers attempt to render the whole of the text into the title page's picture plane.  \
\
This leads me back to an earlier thought about this section on emblems.  Initially, I wasn't convinced that your earlier description of "Emblem as Machine" (7.03) analogy made sense or, more likely, I felt I was missing something.  As I got to thinking about the title page of Hobbes, I recollected that Hobbes begins his Leviathan with a series of interrelated metaphors linking together God and nature; man, machines ("engines"/"automata" in his words) and the higher form, (as he sees it) art.  This leading to the visual metaphor depicted on his title page, whereas the Monarch is the brain (or reason) operating the cyborg "this artificial man" (part man / part machine in Hobbes's complex metaphor) whose body is composed of the Monarch's subjects but described with mechanical language (rather than biological, for example).   \
\
Hobbes's nested and mixed metaphors are followed by a discussion of reading books vs. reading men vs. "reading thyself".  He then returns to his earlier cyborg Monarch metaphor.  When the Monarch is reading himself, he reads all of mankind.  \
\
Hobbes creates a riddle-like metaphor-laden passage, which seems like an attempt to summarize the entirety of his book, very much like the model you describe here of emblems with their accompanying poem.  With all of his mixed and/or nested metaphors it seems possible that his use of mechanical language also makes a connection between the play between emblem and text.  Or, stated more simply, he seems to suggest that the text animates the emblem (this being the age of print, this animation plays out in our minds).  The accompanying text provides the necessary code for how the emblem is to function (a code that wouldn't make sense on its own, or would at least remain incomplete, without the presence of the emblem itself).  \
\
You discuss the role of medieval mnemonics as providing a model for the visual spaces of printed texts.  Even in the Hobbes's (or Brahe's) texts we can see the spatial or room metaphor of the classic medieval mnemonics continue (whereas related information is stored spatially in particular rooms).  The emblem seems to take this mnemonic out of the imagination onto the page, where it evolves overtime, still serving its mnemonic function but put to ever expanding uses.  \
\
I apologize for this overlong (rambling) comment, but I am still left wondering about your use of the term "machine."  By my count (and electronic texts make this easy!) you only use the phrase machine twice, once in the section "Emblem as Machine" (7.03) (and only in the very beginning of this section) and then again once more in section 7.15.  \
\
In what sense are emblems machines?  Perhaps this could use some more explaining.  I think you are onto something but your use of the phrase still isn't clear too me.  I think part of the difficulty maybe that it is a means of explaining the almost entirely unexplainable functioning across images and texts in a dynamic way.  (This seems to be the reason Hobbes utilizes the language of machines.)  \
\
These two OED definitions seem to be approaching what you mean:\
"A material structure designed for a specific purpose, and related uses" (def. II, first used in late 16th century) and "An apparatus constructed to perform a task or for some other purpose" (def. IV, first used in mid-17th century).\
\
I get why Hobbes, in his time, would look to the machine as a metaphor for animating his image via his text.  This is of his time.  Your discussing works predating Hobbes, and I'm not sure if this "animating" concept I described above is what you are getting at.  It is a metaphor, but I still feel like I'm missing something with how it is used here.  (And this could just be me, because I haven't had time to deeply read what you have here--which is one of the clearest and best discussions of emblems I've seen.)`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko/2009021906 Firefox/3.0.7`,``,`0`,`19`,`3`,\N

While I agree that it's quite hard to read a scholarly text like this on a computer screen generally (eye strain, internet issues, clunky computer, etc), I think the text might be easier to read if it were possible to spread it out across the screen in two broad columns (like the "book" reading function in MS Word), rather than having all of the text squashed to one side while the comments and the contents fields occupy two-thirds of the screen. I'm not suggesting that comments and contents fields disappear -- it's lovely to be able to see them alongside the text -- but perhaps the contents at least could be arranged horizontally at the top of the screen? Just an idea. I was also wondering if there's a way to flag or annotate pieces of text for my own personal use to come back to next time I log in to carry on reading -- ?

At least as heavy a censorship, although much more subtly imposed, has been the bottom line of textbook publishing-- what plates cost, which images are already licensed to profitable companies-- all of this has much to do with what is easy or difficult to teach, and therefore what is taught.

The long, loose lines in greyish ink quoting a bit of doggerel in Italian, "Chi vuol saver..." are by yet another reader.

I see how the Catones can be read of the two admirable individuals. As Hannah Zdansky noted in her remark at 2.02 above, medieval and humanist authors knew both figures and had a good sense of the reputation of the clan. But as you will have noticed throughout my writing, I am fascinated by the way these personal names are transferred to the books themselves. Do you think Bebel might have intended a double meaning, so that these "Catones" are books, constructed in parallel to "the book called Cato" as well as contrasted with the two human Catos? Perhaps he would have used "a quibus" instead of "in quibus" if he meant it to be read the way I translated it?`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10`,``,`144`,`2`,`3`,\N

The Latin in note 95 is the entire text of the rubric which precedes the Cato in this edition of the Donat and which separates the Pseudo-Donatus rules from the precepts of Pseudo Cato. The sense might be understood as instruction in  liberal arts and also every appropriate virtue. The rubricator seems to be struggling to get both grammatical and moral instruction into his brief advertisement for the book.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10`,``,`0`,`2`,`3`,\N

In fact, the interplay of base text, commentary by several critics across nine or ten centuries, and illustrations in the new technology of print is exactly the kind of cumulative, collaborative scholarship we are hoping to promote. It already exists informally within circles of colleagues and friends, but putting it online changes the dynamic for the better and offers a (perhaps utopian) opportunity to enlarge the conversation still further. \
\
I do think, however, that it is worth trying to figure out what is NOT staying the same. For me, the highly structured Renaissance page offers a hierarchy of authority that is not congenial today. Exactly because there are specialists out there who know more about a specific text than I do, my research report is open to question and correction. And because a number of artists and designers have made notes too, I have acquired new eyes for the beauty or interest of things that looked ordinary or even banal before.\
\
Again, these comment fields let me add notes on things I am observing anew. For example, in this page the type in this detail from a title page seems to sag. This irregular effect sometimes actually occurs in early printing, but here it is an illusion caused by the way the photo was cropped to show just the text. In the fuller image given at 0.07, you can make out clearly that it is caused by the fact that the page would not lay flat for the photographer. For both conservation and aesthetic reasons, I prefer to have the bowing of the page shown, but just here it may cause some viewers to judge the facts of the printing wrongly.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)`,``,`206`,`2`,`0`,\N

It does not have an exact equivalent in the sixteenth century, but it helps us understand the elitism of the Latin school curriculum. Italians of the period had a clear sense that the full-dress Latin course was most appropriate for boys of the political classes. Correspondingly, they knew that most boys and women did not have access to this course except through the charity or good will of some educators. The interesting thing about the prefaces to the self-study books that appear in the 1520s is that their authors both recognize this opportunity gap and set out to remedy it by selling their new books to this under-served group. This kind of sales pitch is perennial for self-help books --look at Amazon any day!-- but it is still a novelty at this period.\
\
Your reference to Marxism, Eric, raises a slightly different question too, namely, does the awareness of class differences necessarily imply tension or conflict between the two groups? Although many of the voices we can hear in the period deny such tension --they tend to see class differences as inevitable and to respond in terms of the obligation to Christian charity-- there is also plenty of explicit evidence that the rulers felt there was social tension and that a degree of social mobility through education was one way of relieving it.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.14) Gecko/2009082707 Firefox/3.0.14`,``,`215`,`2`,`1`,\N

This debate went on largely in Italian, but necessarily involved the value of classical poetic models, Terence being a standard author.

The ability to mechanically print texts led to standardized testing and teaching to the masses, removing the regionalizing.  I think your point that "the classroom affords us a window on groups of readers" is still true and although the delivery of texts have become more standardized and consistent the view is still not clear.  You state that as students grow intellectually as readers they "employ these skills with increasing degrees of individualism", Educators are faced with a decreased level of overall understanding and comprehension of material in and out of the classrooms by the students who stuggle to grow individually in the face of standardized testing and mass production of classroom textbooks.

I agree that the classroom "affords us a window on groups of readers, but does not always give us a clear view."  This statement could not be truer as we face standardized testing efforts based on mass produced generalized text books which are used in classrooms.  Students struggle to comprehend material and 'keep up' yet don't actually learn and it is evident on their tests and in their interactions with one another in and out of the classroom.

I find the differing marketing strategies  between Latin grammars, which were based largely on the legitimacy of the authors, and these math and other 'self-help' texts fascinating.  In the previous section I wondered if particular cities could be the basis for legitimacy.  Here I see that Sfortunati cast himself as an experienced teacher and a native speaker of Tuscan, highlighting the importance of vernacular.  I get the sense that there is much less argument between competitors over content in the case of math than over method--whereas content was a major concern for those marketing/selling Latin grammar (even as method was also a key issue).`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3`,``,`0`,`113`,`2`,\N

Some scholars are pilloried (in my view, rightly so) for requiring students to purchase privately published course readers at exorbitant prices.

I have made precious little money off it, but that was not the reason I published it.\
"Humanism for Sale" is surely parallel to numerous other self-published (non-text-) books, some of which have had impressive circulation over time. Having just taught it to a class of ten graduate students, I can say that it provoked lively discussion on numerous levels, including of course the contrast between printed texts and online texts. At the risk of belaboring the obvious, I was struck by how easy it was for the students to gain access to this text: whereas several other excellent monographs from the past decade now cost well over $100 and, if not purchased, must be obtained via interlibrary loan, "Humanism for Sale" popped right up on students' computer screens. Perhaps, as "Google Books" becomes more comprehensive (see Tony Grafton's recent essay on the subject, online in the New Yorker, I believe), the contrast in access will be less stark; but for now, surely, it is highly significant.

Is there any way to make the footnote markers "live" so that one can click on them to gain access and return to the same place in the text? I ended up consulting far fewer of them as I read than I normally would do. Also, since the citations in the notes are overwhelmingly in short form, a live link to the bibliography would help immensely. Eventually I figured out I just needed to download the .pdf of the bibliography and keep it open on the side of the screen.\

I would have to look at the Giunta books in the period very closely to say exactly when the "Nil candidius" was added to their long-standing lily motif. I may just ask Bill Pettas (who published on the Spanish Giunta a few years back and is working on the Italian branches of the family now) to weigh in on this one.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.14) Gecko/2009082707 Firefox/3.0.14`,``,`260`,`2`,`5`,\N

It then appeared often and was the only device by the press used until 1517.  It contains no motto.\
Zappella, fig. 645; Kristeller, Early Florentine Woodcuts, 1897,  fig. 43 and Roberts, Printers' marks (London, 1893), p. 224. \
\
The second device has two putti standing on a chest, each holding a cornucopia and together supporting overhead an elaborate fleur-de-lis.  On the front of the chest are the initials â€˜F.G.' The whole enclosed in a folded ribbon border (135 x 94 mm).  The same border appears also in the 1506 Giunti edition of Dante.  This, the second Giunti device, first appears in the 1517 Orationes of Aristides, the Vitae parallelae of Plutarch and the Icones of Philostratus.  Davies says that Kristeller shows three devices with a similar border: nos. 21, 77, 182.  This is the largest and most important of the early Giunti devices (Kristeller 46) and was last used in the 1527 Xenophon.  Davies, Devices of the early printers, 1457-1560, pp. 312-313, fig. 66 and Zappella, Le marche dei tipografi e degli editori italiani del Cinquecento fig. 646.\
\
The third and fourth devices, both appear in the 1517 Valerius Maximus, one on the title page, the other at the colophon.  These are the only two devices, of the more than 40 used by the Giunti in Florence up to 1625, to use the motto in question.  Zappella, figs. 649 and 647.  Fig. 649 last appeared in 1588 in Dottrina Christiana breve per insegnare in pochi giorni by Diego de Ledesma which is the second part of the work Della scelta d'orazioni divotissime by.Girolamo (in religion Silvano) Razzi;  Fig. 647 made its final appearance in 1617 at the end of the text of Achilles Tatius' Dell'amore di Clitofonte, e Leucippe.  I find it remarkable how long some of the devices were used--or revived after several decades.  I have not used a loupe on the later appearances, but to the naked eye they seem to be identical.\
\
As to your correct remark about the fleur-de-lis and its relation to the Giunti and the city, I might add one little-known note.  The lily is still visible, carved  on the stone lintel of their onetime store in the via Proconsolo, opposite the Badia in Florence.  It is now a store selling briefcases and suitcases and the sweet people running the store knew their place had a long history but were unaware that it was for a century the bookstore of Florence's most famous publishers.  Sadly, even the city of Florence has done nothing, not even a plaque, to record the fact.  I believe it was Douglas McMurtrie who pointed out that the first printer's devices were closely related to the signs over their shops.  And one small correction--Bernardo was the second generation printer, not third.  I am still puzzled by the remark made a century ago by Fumagalli to the effect that Bernardo was made a "comte palatin."  I know of no archival evidence for this, and Fumagalli cited none.  On the face of it, it seems highly unlikely.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; GTB6; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)`,``,`0`,`122`,`5`,\N

So, Ken, this means that the "Nil candidius" motto was devised in 1517, at a moment when Bernardo was still newly in charge of the Giunta house in Florence and when he/they experimented with the mark. The theme of fame is certainly appropriate to Valerius Maximus, where it first appears, but I leave it to you to tell us if Cardinal Giulio is likely to have had any direct influence. Giulio would have been firmly in the saddle as archbishop of Florence, right? And Bernardo would have had every good reason to want to curry favor.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)`,``,`0`,`2`,`5`,\N

So I wonder, is there any evidence that while Spanish, Dutch., etc., humanists were more receptive to the geographic and naturalistic discoveries of the New World, Italian humanists may have still been receptive to discoveries and contact in the other direction, ie, with the Eastern world?

I wonder if the fact that the earliest voyages to the New World, if not done by Italian states still were done with Italian navigators and innovations, allowed for an early interest in the New World discoveries by Italian humanists, only dying out after the imperial powers developed independence from Italian aid. Also, Italy was the place of refuge for those escaping the fall of Byzantium, as well as a main center of contact â€“ through attempted invasions, trade, and attempts at counter-attack â€“ with the Arab/Ottoman world, having much closer contact than the imperial powers like Spain, Portugal, etc., did. Did this result in Italian humanists drawing more inspiration on the geographic/naturalistic discoveries of the East, even if they ignored the discoveries coming in from the other direction? Or was the knowledge of the Muslim/Eastern world so diffused through Europe at this time that it would have had little impact on Italian humanists specifically?`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:6.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.2`,``,`0`,`1723`,`1`,\N

Throughout the period, there was a great deal of debate as to whether it was a positive social good to educate non-elite citizens, and there was a strong party of opinion against it. Local churches in Italy came down strongly in favor of catechism education (Doctrina Christiana --see below, sections 6.11 and 6.12), involving reading and sometimes writing, but there was no impulse comparable to that in N.

The hyper-extended commentaries we see in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries are definitely a creation of the market for print. Some heavily commented texts existed in the Middle Ages, but they were reference copies owned by teachers, scholars, or libraries and usually confected exclusively for local use. Students most often took down the text and whatever notes they needed by dictation. The separate commentaries by humanists were intended for advanced study; I have never seen one bound with a base text, but that may just be because I have not been looking for them. As to the degree of dependence on commentaries, that is hard to say. Certainly there were more choices, and I suspect teachers by the early sixteenth century would not have been comfortable teaching without a commentary to hand. But what we know of teaching in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance suggests that was always true.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.22) Gecko/20110902 Firefox/3.6.22 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0C)`,``,`0`,`5`,`1`,\N

It seems unusual to me to have such a need for correction in reprinted texts.  Presumably, Mancinelli felt this to be normal because of his experiences correcting manuscripts, and in his own role as editor and commentator on the works of other, especially ancient, authors.  However, I begin to wonder about the need for what seems to me to be an excessive amount of corrections and commentaries by publishers in the printed works of Mancinelli.  Is this attitude towards printed grammar books and their constant need for correction an offshoot of manuscript culture, where corrections were commonplace and, presumably, more needed?  Or were these corrections and comments simply a way of advertising reprinted editions of the texts in order to make more money?`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1`,``,`0`,`1733`,`1`,\N

It's not one that I can claim to have done original research on. Rereading my own prose at this point, I can see that I may seem to have intended to suggest a direct, derivative relationship of genre between humanist invective and scholastic disputation. I really meant to say instead that the habit of antagonism typical of scholastic debate was still so much a part of scholarly life in the early Renaissance that it fed naturally into humanist forms. When dealing as I do in this book with the prefaces and other paratexts of published textbooks, it is striking how frequently authors refer to polemical attacks -- often ones that do not survive or cannot easily be found in the record-- that were violent and personal enough to merit replies in print. In the case of famous figures like Erasmus, we have a record of a great deal of the back and forth. For textbook authors (like Mancinelli to whom I refer here) we will probably never know who or how influential his critics were.

What I wanted to convey here is that what we now think of as mainstream Christianity is a highly rhetorical, language-centered faith, but that medieval Christianity --in the absence of widespread literacy, remember-- was strongly visual and oral. One of the lasting effects of humanism was to reclaim the rhetorical tradition of classical culture and make it over into a central fact of Christianity. This could only happen because humanist rhetorical ideas were adopted and made universal through wider literacy and through the medium of commercial print.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.23) Gecko/20110920 Firefox/3.6.23 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0C)`,``,`371`,`5`,`2`,\N

For manuscripts these artists were often part of a workshop team that confected the books to order. For printed books, the tendency was for a wood engraver to work from a pattern provided either by the author or by an artist.

I am aware that, during the Middle Ages and a good part of the Renaissance, the Virgin Mary was presented as the ideal woman in Christian parts of the world.  Women who did not live up to such a standard of purity, submissiveness, and gentleness were often looked upon as deviants, whores, or worse.  How have you seen this dichotomy played out in the emblems, woodcuts, and engravings of the period?  What effects do you think these representations of women had in the lives of the men and few women who were able to access books?\
What Thomas Laquer has called â€œthe One-Sex Modelâ€ was still being taught during this period.  I have seen several illustrations of this model in medical textbooks from the time, and I am curious to know if you have seen examples in non-medical books for students of other disciplines, and also in books of literature and/or poetry.   I agree that people of lower classes and women in general would have been ignorant of how their bodies and their genders were being defined, but how aware of the One-Sex construction of the human body were people who could access education?  Is there any evidence to suggest that anyone was aware or suspected that sex and thus gender were/are social constructions, and that these constructions serve not only to materialize the body, but also to form our conceptions of â€œnatureâ€ itself, as Judith Butler has argued?`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; GTB7.2; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C)`,``,`0`,`1912`,`-1`,\N

It points to the way the tools are handed to us and we make of them what we will, largely unfettered by the intentions of the toolmakers. The makers of emblems seem (after Alciati's apparent initial shock at the way the form got away from him) to have accepted the notion of readers inventing new puzzles on the basis of the published emblems. Unlike printed emblems, of course, the Facebook page owner actually can change what is published, what the public encounters, while the user of an emblem had to be in a position to publish a new book in order to do that. The issue of who cares about how tools are used is perennial, however.

He invented the form as a literary one where the picture was supposed to be imagined by the reader of the poem. Once the reader had imagined the image, then he would re-read and understand the poem more fully. These original emblems were designed for manuscript circulation. The new emblems Alciati added for this later, larger collection, however, were composed after the first set had been published with images made up for the printed book by artists not working directly with Alciati; so we must imagine that he has already re-conceptualized the literary form he invented only a few years earlier and was now probably working with an artist to create emblems with both pictures and poems. This is an unusual moment in literary and media history. We can not only witness the invention of a new genre, but also watch how it was appropriated by new writers, and then watch the inventor respond to the changes wrought by others on his invention. We see this happening online everyday but it was also an exciting event for sixteenth-century people, to watch the media change before their very eyes.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; WOW64; rv:8.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0`,``,`404`,`5`,`5`,\N

Although many of the early writing books are dated, there is some dispute as to their actual dates of publication. I based this very summary sentence and much of the rest of my account on A.S. Olsey's <em>Scribes and Sources</em>, which suggests that the 1522 <em>Operina</em> of Arricghi was rushed into print in order to anticipate Tagliente's known plan to publish, and that the actual date of its appearance was 1523, not 1522. That would put it very close in date to Tagliente's 1524 book. It is certainly clear from the date on the 1522 <em>Operina</em> that Arrighi wanted us to believe that his book was first.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:17.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/17.0`,``,`451`,`5`,`2`,\N

I think that the 1522 date in "La Operina" refers to when Arrighi originally prepared his manuscript. Not only does Osley date it later but so does Stanley Morison. In his "Early Italian Writing-Books," edited by Nicolas Barker (1990), chapter 3 focuses on the publication date of "La Operina." Morison/Barker suggest it was probably printed in the first half of 1524. As you know, in 1525 the book's engraver, Ugo da Carpi, sued for the right to publish his edition. Morison/Barker raise the obvious question: if the book was published in 1522 why did Da Carpi wait 3 years to sue?

This practice is so common in the present, I can hardly imagine reading a textbook without highlighting or writing questions and ideas in the margin. Were these books too valuable to be scribbled in? Or did the advent of printing and resulting ease of text production render them less precious? Or was the idea of writing in a book not so problematic in the first placeâ€”I remember learning that many surviving medieval personal books of devotion, painstakingly composed by scribes, are rife with the handwritten notes of their various owners.

Would it be educators themselves, or would humanists collaborate with monks or another group in order to sort out the manuscripts?`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; GTB7.4; (R1 1.5); .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0C)`,``,`0`,`2167`,`-1`,\N

I am generalizing here, so it may not be clear what the process of limiting meanings was. To understand how it happens, you have to remember that the emblem is structured from the start as a puzzle. The texts do not explain the meaning(s) outright, they only comment on the image and give clues to meaning(s), which are always potentially personal as well as comunitarian. That is, the reader always has the ability to create her own meaning for the image or to suggest alternatives that may or may not have been in the mind of the author. The more text the author adds, however, the more clues the reader gets to move in one direction or another. To cite a trivial example, say, if the author intimates that eagle in the image represents  dominance, then it can only represent themes consistent with that, not those that have to do with flight away from power. There is still room for interpretation by the reader, but she is directed toward certain themes and not others.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:19.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0`,``,`481`,`5`,`5`,\N

I was wondering, how much difference in terms of obscurity/complexity would there be in an image that would be found in a textbook, as compared to an image on a poster or storefront? Would a book image necessarily be much more intellectually demanding in nature?

Once emblems are compiled into books, however, they can afford to be more complex because the book form invites slower,more thoughtful reading. As for today, we have lost the emblem theory, but designers of many things try to include several levels of meaning. The most obvious example is trademarks or logos --just think of the red-white-and-blue theme of many corporations.

We have this rather exaggerated opinion of the power and conformity of the Jesuit order that derives in part from the realities of Jesuit life codified in the seventeenth century and in part from a long Anglo-American political and historiographical tradition of distrust for the order. In the 1550s, however, the order was still new; it was composed of many dedicated and often brilliant men who knew St. Ignatius personally, and who were quickly scattered to many parts of Europe. The later centralization was not yet in place.

Keep in mind that most emblem books at most periods and in most places were not tied closely either to formal education or to schools. They were intended for personal reading, meditation, and enjoyment. They were most often connected to schools in Northern Europe, especially in the Low Countries and Germany, and the Jesuits (see section 13 below) particularly used them.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0`,``,`0`,`2`,`7`,\N

The source documents about the creation of the Ratio have all been published, and they make for fascinating reading. I think the reports of the various committees, quickly summarized in the next paragraph, evidence a process that was for the period genuinely open.

Later works (De institutione grammatica libri tres), reverse the design and give precedence to Avares' name as though it were the title. I imagine this was a deliberate marketing decision to lead with the author's name. It makes me think of those paperback novels you might see in line at the grocery store, where the biggest type on the cover is the name of the author (e.g. Danielle Steel). You have to look closely to see the actual title. In cases like Steel, no matter the title, it's the author's name that sells. In the case of Alvares, it is interesting to see that the book began to be called "Grammatica Emmanuelis," and was even titled as such in later editions. \

Before reading these chapters, I had always guessed that Avlares was your typical author-celebrity typeâ€” wanting to see his name in lights, so to speak. However, the descriptions of him wanting to pass a quiet career as a schoolteacher, his admonitions about boastfulness, and his modesty, make me think it was the Jesuit publishing enterprise that thought to build the Alvares brand the way it did.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:21.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/21.0`,``,`0`,`2383`,`6`,\N

You are absolutely right, Peter, about the Jesuit marketing effort and branding --they phrased it in more traditional terms, promoting the use of a book by "one of our own"-- but it is clearly an effort to create a book with a Jesuit identity. In later years it was used sometimes outside the Jesuit schools, but even then it was identified with them and their particular theories of language education. The evolution of the "Grammatica Emmanuelis" label is a bit of a puzzle to me, though it follows a pattern typical in the book trade. I suspect it started largely as a typographical convention, that is, if you are going to specify the author with both his name and surname, "Emmanuelis" is going to take up nearly a line anyway, so it becomes prominent visually more or less by default. When booksellers and buyers looked at the title page and compared it to others, the most prominent word was the easiest shortcut with which to refer to to book, and gradually this became the commonplace way to refer to it in a crowded market for Latin grammars.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:21.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/21.0`,``,`504`,`5`,`6`,\N

An interesting example, the Psalm translations of Lodovico Pittorio, apparently composed in 1522 and printed many times, are explicated by Ãˆlise Boilet, "La fortune du <em>Psalterio Davitico</em> de Lodovico Pittorio en Italie au XVIe siÃ¨cle," <em>La BibliofilÃ­a</em> 115 (2013), 621-628.

As accessible as a vernacular textbook was, do you think there were still major economic hurdles that might have inhibited their commercial success? I can imagine large institutional buyers (or influencers) and the educated elite shunning the vernacular texts. I recently came across Edmund Reeve's "An Introduction into the Greeke Tongue" (London: NP, 1650), a early Greek grammar in English. The title page reads "Composed for their sakes which understand not Latine; and yet are desirous to have some competent knowledge in the originall sacred scripture." One would think that a basic Greek grammar in English might have a ready audience, yet the book does not appear to have had much life beyond the first edition (a second issue including an an errata leaf was printed in 1657).\
\
Another work that comes to mind is Elizabeth Elstobâ€™s â€œRudiments of Grammar for the English-Saxon Tongueâ€ (London: Printed by W. Bowyer, 1715). The book is the first Anglo-Saxon grammar in English, and Elstobâ€™s preface speaks to why she wrote it: "Considering the pleasure I myself had reaped from the knowledge I have gained from the original of our mother tongue, and that others of my own sex, might be capable of the same satisfaction: I resolv'd to give them the rudiments of that language in English dress.â€ This beautifully printed book, with new Anglo-Saxon types created for the project, was a commercial flop. It was ignored in favor of other works (in Latin) in use at the time. Like Reeveâ€™s grammar, Elstobâ€™s book ended with the first edition.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/43.0.2357.65 Safari/537.36`,``,`0`,`2383`,`3`,\N

Both of them offer personal histories--apparently pretty singular if not in fact entirely original-- for how difficult it was for the non-Latin literate to study ancient languages. Although both Reeve and Elstob saw immediately how it would help others to have an introductory text in English, they did not recognize that their own experiences were so nearly unique that there was no built-in audience for their books. It is easy for us to underestimate the conservatism of educators in the early modern period. The institutional buyers all wanted textbooks that would fit the existing curriculum, not entirely new ones. \
\
Still, your initial question about marketing rhetoric merits some further thought, for at least Reeve and Elstob specifically devised addresses to non-Latin reading potential users. This practice of imagining a not-very-educated reader/user goes back at least to Tagliente, and there are other examples later in this chapter too --see 6.17 on "poor churchfolk."\
\
I'll hope to come back to this theme with further examples, and maybe some more solutions too.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0`,``,`558`,`5`,`3`,\N

Before printing (and therefore before the marketing impulse was strong), there is a regular distinction between those who read (Latin) and those who are illiterate. It appears especially in prefaces to translations of Latin works into vernaculars in the manuscript period, where the reader is addressed sometimes fairly personally. It seems to me to take on new meaning in the "how-to" period we encounter several times in Humanism For Sale, e.g. at 4.14 and 4.18 above, and below at 6.11, where it is clearly a marketing tool. The key period for this is the 1520s. \

Knowing what we know about humanism during the Renaissance, there could be several reasons why he would refuse such a position. One could be that Mancinelli was solely interested in educating as many students as possible, even if that meant refusing the benefits that came with "personal, noble patronage." Similarly, it seems to me that humanists would advocate a sort of "mass education" or public education that did not rely on social class (perhaps with the exception of Montaigne). Mancinelli's decision may very well have been working toward this ideal of education for all, which had now been made possible by the advent of printing.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/48.0.2564.97 Safari/537.36`,``,`0`,`5845`,`2`,\N

He was not content with the knowledge that he knew to be true in the past and he continually wanted to improve his texts for himself and his students. On the other hand, even if the mistakes in his texts really were the printer's errors, it still shows the idea that education is always changing and can be improved. The invention of the printing press was revolutionary in more ways than one-- it allowed for a continual conversation between scholars. Mancinelli also proves his humanistic educational style by urging other scholars, most likely other grammar scholars, to inspect his work and provide commentary. This shows the he valued the importance of community and understanding others' opinions. I also think he embodies another human characteristic of diversity by teaching in several different cities; however, I do not see this sense of diversity in his general teaching since he mainly teaches about grammar and its related subjects.\
\
It is obvious that Mancinelli was a competitive writer and educator throughout his entire life, which I think is extremely important to learning.

It is always difficult to speculate about motives absent specific evidence, but in Mancinelli's case we have a rich body of prefaces and personal and business letters that address many of the points you raise. You are correct to see Mancinelli's motives in the context of public education (though at the period we have to remember that that left out most working class people and almost all women). I think the key to his attitude is in his small-town origins, where a cadre of local notables wanted to improve education locally. It's unlikely than any of them could see to see the results we do as a result of printing --really widespread literacy. But Mancinelli  did recognize printing immediately as a tool for making his job easier and making his students' work easier too.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:43.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/43.0`,``,`580`,`5`,`2`,\N

The two purposes of the work that Mancinelli mentions to his son are morals and Latin. This is a representation of the Humanist era because it was a movement from medieval times that began to focus more on the goodness of man. The teaching of Latin during this time was important as well since the Renaissance, and the Humanism movement in particular, stressed the newfound importance of language. Mentioning the different meanings of words between Humanism and feudal times is another representation of the movement away from medieval society and towards a new appreciation of Greek and Roman thought and of language. \
\
However, I thought it was interesting that he made a mention to the Pope since Humanism started the movement away from the church and towards the importance of man's own thought.

Then the following paragraph in 3.02 (paragraph five) contrasts Pellissonâ€™s reaction to the flaws in his text with Mancinelliâ€™s response to the flaws in his own work. Despite the different reactions, the idea of a difference between acclaim and quality seem to resonate with this section (3.09). Since Mancinelli eventually decided to reprint his texts, he was able to increase the quality of his work so that its worth could be closer to the acclaim that it received. In this way, the ability to reprint sounds like an important triumph for education. Additionally, I wonder how much more accessible it made educational materials to the masses. I was wondering if the prices of Mancinelliâ€™s books would have been more competitive too-- making the older editions more accessible to those without the means for a high quality education. From what I know about education during the Renaissance, some scholars (such as Montaigne) were mostly concerned with educating the nobles.

This was certainly not new to humanist learning; indeed, one of the things the early humanists most disliked about medieval scholasticism was the pettiness of the arguments back and forth. The humanist ideal was one of rhetorical truth achieved by argument, to be sure, but typically within a context of collaboration. Mancinelli's many scholarly commentaries were largely aimed at making the base text available to the broad public that printing made possible. \
\
I'd have to think a little more about the ideal of diversity. Certainly what we mean by that would not fit the situation in Renaissance Italy. Mancinelli's moving around from city to city probably had more to do with careerism than a love of being in different places.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:43.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/43.0`,``,`581`,`5`,`0`,\N

It is clear, however, that the small textbook-type booklets he wrote for students were relatively cheap. As one of your colleagues remarked at section 3.05, however, this meant that he was aiming for a market of citizen schools, not at the education of aristocrats.\
\
As for the urge to correct, this is common to most scholars, but it was given new possibilities with the invention of printing. Printing meant that many more copies of an erroneous text could circulate, but reprinting meant that there was a new opportunity --fueled by market competition-- to make the texts better in later editions.\

The relationship of humanism to the church is not an easy one to describe, because there were so many different solutions, almost as many as there were serious thinkers in the period. Mancinelli is writing on the eve of the Reformation, when many intellectuals were dissatisfied with the corruption of the church and their relative inability to effect reforms. Manicnelli,however, seems to have been a pretty conformist type. He is very devoutly religious and does not seem to have felt there was any real or necessary break between classical scholarship and Christian orthodoxy. I suspect this was a common stance among humanists, especially those of the second rank. It is worth remembering in this regard that, although I have devoted an entire chapter to him, Mancinelli was not one of the great thinkers of the period.

The paragraph also emphasizes the issues of incorrectness in the textbooks by limiting the mistakes populated by the manuscripts copies. It also provides students with meaningful older pedagogical principles. It depicts the quickness of the instruction and the curriculum. Most of all, Mancinelli put a stress on how well the publishing opportunity protect the integrity of Latin.

Good teachers adopt the best textbooks, and though there are many other things that go into marketing textbooks, class is not very overtly one of them. Certainly, private tuition was restricted to the wealthy --either aristocrats or well-to-do merchant families-- but the teacher will use the texts that best fits his/her students' needs. What differs is that a private tutor can use pretty much any text, manuscript or printed, and tailor the curriculum closely to one or two students, while a schoolmaster is going to find distinct advantages in using printed texts that are designed for use by many students in a single classroom.\

\
In addition, there is an interesting point brought up about the comments and references made in the margins. The idea that you not only buy the literature for the content of the creator, but for the content provided to you by the scholar. It is truly the 15th century version of "peer-reviewed" in a sense. Also, that those comments could be lost in "translation" and recreation during printing we bring into question the importance of content versus the method used to diffuse the content.

He fostered the importance of education, but also stressed the need for correction. He contested the works of major authors and didn't take any of his own knowledge for granted. Mancinelli encouraged students to diversify their knowledge and opinions by looking at different interpretations of certain subjects. \
\
I see many similarities between Mancinelli and Montaigne, a humanist in Renaissance France. They both draw upon the ideas of contesting ancient works that were never before doubted, discovering new knowledge at every point in life, and being open to different opinions.\
\
However, in Chapter 25 "Sur l'education des enfants" in Book One of "Essais," Montaigne draws upon the importance of conversation between students and teachers. He says that is essential for students to question the teachings they are being taught in class. This can come from having discussions with the teacher or opening their mind to new worldly experiences. \
\
From what I gathered, Mancinelli mainly focuses on the discussion between teachers to figure out the best methods to teach students. He does not seem to mention much about the discussions in the classroom.

Just in this case, of scholarly work on Valla, authors like Erasmus and Mancinelli were attempting to profit (whether materially or just in prestige) from a humanist text that had already become a classic. \

Montaigne represents a highly developed version of humanism, strongly secularizing and literary, and aimed at adult readers. Mancinelli was a teacher, devout and religiously conformist, with rather more limited goals for his readers, who were after all mostly students. \

Historical scholarship on the importance of the religious dimension of Renaissance humanism has varied a lot over the years, but in recent decades we have come to realize that many humanists were pretty content with traditional religious values and even strictures. I think the essential novelty of humanism was not to judge truth or human value <em>solely</em> on religious grounds, but to admit to other sources of truth and to argue for a kind of natural morality that does not depend on religion for validation or even guidance. This is not to say there were no more radical and even anti-religious humanists, merely that there were many who did not see much conflict at all between humanist and religious morality.

Creating an idea is a difficult task because the creator is using his/her own innate imagination to bring something new into existence. Now, this is the entire premise of the Renaissance, to create new ideas and new values for life with inspiration from the past, in the midst of technological inventions that aided in the transmission of the later. My mind then drifted to the concept of â€œreproductionâ€. In this context, â€œreproductionâ€ is unoriginal and, in a sense, unfortunate. It pulls the readers attention away from the beauty of the creation process and the authenticity of the authors own language, due to the many errors Mancinelli mentioned occurred as a result of mass printing. Why did you choose to use these words to describe printers? I ask this question because the printing press was a novelty that opened the doors for knowledge to be transmitted literally across cultures and across nations. I see this as an asset, not a draw back. This phrase is essentially putting the creator (humans) against machine (printing press). Remember the creator was the one who brought the machine into existence. I feel I am pushing the boarders to the philosophical level, which many humanists would be proud of. I cannot even begin to imagine our generation surviving without the basic necessity of print. There are pros and cons to the argument. Mancinelli praises the product of the printing press, that is the mass transmission of knowledge, but critics its frequent errors and the constant need to update the text. He enjoys the many benefits the printing press has allowed for in the realm of teaching and education, but discusses that it also â€œgave some fairly ordinary teachers in Mancinelli's generation (and ever since) the opportunity for a permanent, or at least long-term literary reputation specifically as textbook writers.â€`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5) AppleWebKit/601.3.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/9.0.2 Safari/601.3.9`,``,`0`,`5843`,`3`,\N

\
I may have missed it in another section, but I was wondering if there were any institutions or bodies that regulated what was printed/diffused? Of course there are examples such as that of Martin Luther who used the written word to express discontent with the censorship of the established church, but were there any measures in place to ensure that what was printed was not used to deceive the masses? The advent of technology that rapidly diffuses information seems to me as a double edged sword, with those whose agenda includes actually spreading useful knowledge with others whose agenda includes falsification of major historical events, revisions to fit a prescribed world view, etc. It seems as though with the cost of owning or running a printing machine, only the elite had the opportunity to spread knowledge, possibly to the detriment of others. As always with technology there is this potential for benefit or hinderance, and I'm wondering what other downsides, if any, there were to the introduction of print? (other than printing errors) I'm mostly thinking along the lines of how rewriting information by hand and story telling are two very effective ways to memorize information rather than simply reading printed words on a page and memorizing, which may lead to pacification in smaller tutoring style settings`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/48.0.2564.109 Safari/537.36`,``,`0`,`5862`,`4`,\N

The ancient Greeks had the same worry, or claimed to, about writing itself. And of course, educational alarmists now claim that digital media are ruining the abilities of young people to think and read reflectively. The difference is that now we have neurological instruments that let us measure such things. We will know (to some degree) about how present day young people differ from their elders and even more about the next generation; what we do not know is how the earlier technologies changed ancient or early modern brains. \

Regulation in the Renaissance was --to our eyes-- unimaginably inefficient. Local governments could keep surveillance on and regulate local trade, but there were no systems to extend that control very far. Printing eventually spawned many attempts at press regulation and censorship, but, as Luther's case demonstrates, it was not at all effective in the fifteenth and early sixteenth century; and even later, you just had to go to the next town with a willing printer to get something into print. Control of the market for school books was more effective in the sense that teachers had to approve what was used, but there was a lot of competition. The only case of a textbook that was really widely imposed is described in Chapter 5 below, for the Jesuit schools, and even there some teachers did not conform entirely.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:43.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/43.0`,``,`0`,`5`,`4`,\N

That one grammar by the internationally known Giovanni Battista Cantalicio (d. 1515) and another by the obscure Angelo Fino (dates unknown) survive in this way suggests that the city had a micro-market for single editions of such works, presumably created at mid 16th century for a local school. Cantalicio is in fact another example of a Perugian master (he taught grammar there ca. 1488) whose textbooks achieved international status because they were publsihed in Siena, Rome, Venice and elsewhere. The Perugian edition mentioned by Rhodes is the only one known to have been printed there, and it dates from some years after the author's death. `,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0`,``,`0`,`5`,`5`,\N

This argues further for a local tradition of a schoolmaster or masters in the 1570s and 80s who adopted this textbook, either for its intrinsic value or because of the tradition that Cantalicio had taught at Perugia. Another locality where the text got editions quite late is Florence. Then too, three of the rare surviving copies of the late Perugian editions survive in libraries at Assisi (which is just a few miles from Perugia), suggesting that there may have been a school there which adopted Cantalicio's textbook some 70 years after his death.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:49.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/49.0`,``,`633`,`2`,`5`,\N

The organization into chapter sub-divisions does pose some issues for me because the chapters seem overly-fragmented and disconnected. The comment section on each page also seems a bit too large, pushing the text too far to one side.

The website itself looks dated and having the contents on the open side seems like a good idea, but it tends to drag pages on longer then they should creating a lot of empty space. Having a contents tab that could be opened at any time rather than having it always on the screen would certainly help alleviate some of the issues.

How do we advertise these resources to the audience that will most benefit from them? It seems like Humanism for Sale has been very successful in drawing in an active body of interlocutors. How was this accomplished?`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:62.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/62.0`,``,`0`,`5963`,`1`,\N

This software was developed for reading on a screen and it does not read well on either tablets or smart phones. We have found this a major problem with undergrads, who want to be able to do their class assignments on their phones.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:62.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/62.0`,``,`691`,`5`,`0`,\N

You are right to point to the limited interactivity of Humanism For Sale, not so much because of the software but simply because we do not normally interact repeatedly with scholarly monographs. Typically such works get reviews (traditionally in print) and then accumulate a citation history in the relevant scholarly literature. But even scholars in the filed who might comment once on first reading will not comment on later readings, merely cite and go on to something else. By contrast to some e-fiction and music which is intended to grow via additions from an audience, the audience for a monograph is mostly static. Indeed if you quickly scan the HFS comments, only a few have multiple replies. The greatest number of comments, moreover, are my own, intended to bring the discussion up to date with citations of new literature.`,`0`,`1`,`Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:62.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/62.0`,``,`0`,`5`,`1`,\N
