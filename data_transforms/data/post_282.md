This chapter offers another case study, of the Latin grammar of Manuel Alvares, S.J. (1526-1583). This book appeared in both student and teacherâ€™s editions. Commissioned by the Jesuit order, it became the best selling Latin textbook of the early modern age, remaining in print into the late nineteenth century.
