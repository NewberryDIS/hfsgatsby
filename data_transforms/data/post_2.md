<em>Humanism For Sale</em> is an experiment.  We are using the Word Press blog platform and the Comment Press theme to begin a dialog based on a new scholarly monograph about the creation and sale of school books in Europe between 1450 and 1650. For a description of the project and its background, see the web pages at <a title="Humanism For Sale" href="http://www.humanismforsale.org" target="_blank">www.humanismforsale.org</a>. These pages also offer some advice for getting around the text if you are not used to blogging.

\nYou can use the more detailed table of contents at left to find what most interests you in the book. The comparable contents column on the right will appear on every page, so you can move forward or back without returning to this page. The search box at top right will get you to keywords in the text. At the moment there are only a few illustrations in text, drawn from the collections of the Newberry Library. Clicking on the thumbnails will give you a larger image. Footnotes use abbreviated forms by reference to a full bibliography in the accompanying web pages.
\n
\nAs time permits we will provide more illustrations, better indexing, and additional gateways for readers who are not historians but who are interested in the history of design, marketing, and education.
