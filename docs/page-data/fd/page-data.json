It's an experiment. At this point, you can find plenty of examples here, but if you want to get deeply into individual subjects, you need to use the Table of Contents, look at my discussion, and then follow the links to the footnotes and <a href=\"bib.pdf\">bibliography</a>. (323KB PDF file)</p>\n<p>Way too cumbersome! So I want to do better for you -- sooner or later.</p>\n<p>Below is a list of the issues I think might interest designers. I also hope to create a separate Design Bibliography. Meanwhile, I definitely welcome suggestions about how to make the site and this section more useful.</p>\n<p>Type issues\r\nBlackletter vs. Roman. This issue was debated largely on philosophical grounds.\r\nSingle type size. The earliest printers had only one size to work with. Boy did they work at it!\r\nDisplay types were invented only gradually and used sparingly.\r\nUse of italics. Invented around 1500, italics quickly became a tool for clarifying content.</p>\n<p>Layout</p>\n<p>Title pages\r\nOrigin of the title page. Title pages derived from the needs of booksellers.\r\nLayout of title pages evolved slowy as display types became available.</p>\n<p>Illustration, Ornament and Diagrams\r\nTrue illustration was a fairly rare device in schoolbooks. Music and geography books offer some exceptions.\r\nDiagrams also turn up in math books and other technical textbooks.\r\nWhat we think of as ornament often had important philosophical import for early textbook publishers.\r\nThe emblem book was an entirely new form of the 16th century that combined picture and text for recreational, philosophical and educational purposes.</p>\n<p>Design for Marketing\r\nTitle pages were the principal site for marketing books, using advertising blurbs.\r\nIndexes were frequently touted as selling points.\r\nPrinter's prefaces and afterwards offer explanations of what innovations were on offer.\r\nPrinter's marks were important for marketing and for communication between printers and readers.</p>\n<p>Design Players\r\nAuthors sometimes exerted control, but there is relatively little evidence.\r\nPrinters were usually their own desingers, responsible for the look of the book.\r\nPublishers assumed this role increasingly as the 16th century progressed.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/fd","title":"For Designers","postid":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5409be7f-4b22-5ad4-aa78-0bbdede26148","frontmatter__slug":"/fd","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"fd"}}},
