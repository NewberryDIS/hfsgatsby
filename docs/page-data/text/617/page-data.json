These cuts did not represent additional cost to the printer since they were simply blocks reused from an earlier Latin edition.

(92)</p>\n<p>The principal rival to Bonaventura's <em>Breviloquium</em> on the Italian market at the turn of the sixteenth century was an anonymously compiled <em>Compendium musices</em> that received several editions between 1499 and 1509. It is less well organized than the <em>Breviloquium</em>, merely a series of observations on basic music theory that might be useful to singers. It may have been intended more for choirmasters than for simple choristers, a supposition confirmed by its subsequent history. After 1509 it appeared in print more than twenty five times, but only as a preface to other, more extensive handbooks for liturgists.</p>\n<p>From 1513 to 1566 it was often printed in combination with the Cantorinus, a small, cheaply printed collection of specimen chants (primarily initial and final phrases) for use on various feast days throughout the year. From 1523 onward, the <em>Compendium</em> was also included in the <em>Rituale</em>, a large reference book of prayers and chants. (93) Both the <em>Compendium musices</em> and the <em>Breviloquium</em> of Bonaventura were practical texts for clerics who sang professionally. Neither had any pretensions to teach music theory as a cultural ornament.</p>\n<p>A similar audience, though perhaps one more open to humanist ideals, was intended for the <em>Sparks of Music</em> by Giovanni Maria Lanfranco (ca. 1490-1545), published at Brescia in 1533. This work does not seem to have been influential; but it was a real textbook for singers -- simple, step-by-step instructions with good examples for practice. Lanfranco dressed his book with elaborate front matter that claimed a classical pedigree for his teachings, but the remaining one hundred forty four pages are strictly matter of fact. Tellingly, he deliberately wrote not in Latin or literary Tuscan, but in \"the universal Italian speech\" (an all-purpose North-Italian amalgam), \"in order not to offend the ears of most with some words spoken in too Tuscan a fashion.\" More self-consciously than any earlier music writer, Lanfranco identified his audience as beginners.

The physical form of such books changed little, so that the first editions of the <em>Compendium musices</em> (1499) look much like copies of the <em>Ladder of Music</em> (<em>Scala di musica</em>) of Orlando Scaletta (1650-1630) published until 1665. Even a fashionable composer like Adriano Banchieri (d. 1634) published four small booklets for teaching plainchant in the traditional, downscale format between 1601 and 1623.
