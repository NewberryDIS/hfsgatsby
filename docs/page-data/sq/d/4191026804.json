I've recently located a stationer's shop from that city (ASM, notarile, 4 March 1613, f. 24498) in which the presence of Bossi is particularly striking. The inventory lists 70 dozen (840 copies) \"regole Bosso\" with a wholesale price of just under 2 soldi/copy. Alvares' grammar (\"emanuel\") appears on the list too, but only in 12 copies, each listed at 16 soldi/copy.</p>\n<p>Also recorded in quantity and variety are donati (\"al sena\"; \"al vocaboli\") and the <em>regola</em> of Guarino (in one case combined with the donato). Like Bossi's work, these are described as being sold in bundles of 12 (dozzina)** and priced as such. Wholesale prices fall in a narrow range, from 1 soldo for the cheapest donato (printed on 4 1/2 sheets) to just under 3 soldi for a text combining the regola and donato.</p>\n<p>All of this is strong

Initially, I wasn't convinced that your earlier description of \"Emblem as Machine\" (7.03) analogy made sense or, more likely, I felt I was missing something. As I got to thinking about the title page of Hobbes, I recollected that Hobbes begins his Leviathan with a series of interrelated metaphors linking together God and nature; man, machines (\"engines\"/\"automata\" in his words) and the higher form, (as he sees it) art. This leading to the visual metaphor depicted on his title page, whereas the Monarch is the brain (or reason) operating the cyborg \"this artificial man\" (part man / part machine in Hobbes's complex metaphor) whose body is composed of the Monarch's subjects but described with mechanical language (rather than biological, for example).</p>\n<p>Hobbes's nested and mixed metaphors are followed by a discussion of reading books vs. reading men vs. \"reading thyself\". He then returns to his earlier cyborg Monarch metaphor. When the Monarch is reading himself, he reads all of mankind.</p>\n<p>Hobbes creates a riddle-like metaphor-laden passage, which seems like an attempt to summarize the entirety of his book, very much like the model you describe here of emblems with their accompanying poem. With all of his mixed and/or nested metaphors it seems possible that his use of mechanical language also makes a connection between the play between emblem and text. Or, stated more simply, he seems to suggest that the text animates the emblem (this being the age of print, this animation plays out in our minds). The accompanying text provides the necessary code for how the emblem is to function (a code that wouldn't make sense on its own, or would at least remain incomplete, without the presence of the emblem itself).</p>\n<p>You discuss the role of medieval mnemonics as providing a model for the visual spaces of printed texts. Even in the Hobbes's (or Brahe's) texts we can see the spatial or room metaphor of the classic medieval mnemonics continue (whereas related information is stored spatially in particular rooms). The emblem seems to take this mnemonic out of the imagination onto the page, where it evolves overtime, still serving its mnemonic function but put to ever expanding uses.</p>\n<p>I apologize for this overlong (rambling) comment, but I am still left wondering about your use of the term \"machine.\" By my count (and electronic texts make this easy!) you only use the phrase machine twice, once in the section \"Emblem as Machine\" (7.03) (and only in the very beginning of this section) and then again once more in section 7.15.</p>\n<p>In what sense are emblems machines? Perhaps this could use some more explaining. I think you are onto something but your use of the phrase still isn't clear too me. I think part of the difficulty maybe that it is a means of explaining the almost entirely unexplainable functioning across images and texts in a dynamic way. (This seems to be the reason Hobbes utilizes the language of machines.)</p>\n<p>These two OED definitions seem to be approaching what you mean:</p>\n<p>\"A material structure designed for a specific purpose, and related uses\" (def. II, first used in late 16th century) and \"An apparatus constructed to perform a task or for some other purpose\" (def. IV, first used in mid-17th century).</p>\n<p>I get why Hobbes, in his time, would look to the machine as a metaphor for animating his image via his text. This is of his time. Your discussing works predating Hobbes, and I'm not sure if this \"animating\" concept I described above is what you are getting at. It is a metaphor, but I still feel like I'm missing something with how it is used here. (And this could just be me, because I haven't had time to deeply read what you have here--which is one of the clearest and best discussions of emblems I've seen.)</p>","excerpt":"Your discussion of emblems is fascinating.

Italians of the period had a clear sense that the full-dress Latin course was most appropriate for boys of the political classes. Correspondingly, they knew that most boys and women did not have access to this course except through the charity or good will of some educators. The interesting thing about the prefaces to the self-study books that appear in the 1520s is that their authors both recognize this opportunity gap and set out to remedy it by selling their new books to this under-served group.

Davies says that Kristeller shows three devices with a similar border: nos. 21, 77, 182.

It is now a store selling briefcases and suitcases and the sweet people running the store knew their place had a long history but were unaware that it was for a century the bookstore of Florence's most famous publishers. Sadly, even the city of Florence has done nothing, not even a plaque, to record the fact. I believe it was Douglas McMurtrie who pointed out that the first printer's devices were closely related to the signs over their shops.

Students most often took down the text and whatever notes they needed by dictation.

We have this rather exaggerated opinion of the power and conformity of the Jesuit order that derives in part from the realities of Jesuit life codified in the seventeenth century and in part from a long Anglo-American political and historiographical tradition of distrust for the order. In the 1550s, however, the order was still new; it was composed of many dedicated and often brilliant men who knew St. Ignatius personally, and who were quickly scattered to many parts of Europe. The later centralization was not yet in place. What fascinates me most about the Alvares grammar is that it was one of the first products in publishing history to gain anything like the popularity and widespread influence that even a routine Microsoft release gets today.</p>","excerpt":"Right, Peter.

I imagine this was a deliberate marketing decision to lead with the author's name. It makes me think of those paperback novels you might see in line at the grocery store, where the biggest type on the cover is the name of the author (e.g. Danielle Steel). You have to look closely to see the actual title. In cases like Steel, no matter the title, it's the author's name that sells. In the case of Alvares, it is interesting to see that the book began to be called \"Grammatica Emmanuelis,\" and was even titled as such in later editions.</p>\n<p>Before reading these chapters, I had always guessed that Avlares was your typical author-celebrity type\"” wanting to see his name in lights, so to speak.

You are absolutely right, Peter, about the Jesuit marketing effort and branding --they phrased it in more traditional terms, promoting the use of a book by \"one of our own\"-- but it is clearly an effort to create a book with a Jesuit identity. In later years it was used sometimes outside the Jesuit schools, but even then it was identified with them and their particular theories of language education. The evolution of the \"Grammatica Emmanuelis\" label is a bit of a puzzle to me, though it follows a pattern typical in the book trade. I suspect it started largely as a typographical convention, that is, if you are going to specify the author with both his name and surname, \"Emmanuelis\" is going to take up nearly a line anyway, so it becomes prominent visually more or less by default. When booksellers and buyers looked at the title page and compared it to others, the most prominent word was the easiest shortcut with which to refer to to book, and gradually this became the commonplace way to refer to it in a crowded market for Latin grammars.</p>","excerpt":"Bingo!

The title page reads \"Composed for their sakes which understand not Latine; and yet are desirous to have some competent knowledge in the originall sacred scripture.\" One would think that a basic Greek grammar in English might have a ready audience, yet the book does not appear to have had much life beyond the first edition (a second issue including an an errata leaf was printed in 1657).</p>\n<p>Another work that comes to mind is Elizabeth Elstob's \"œRudiments of Grammar for the English-Saxon Tongue\" (London: Printed by W.

Your question is one of the big issues in the scholarship on the Renaissance. The relationship of humanism to the church is not an easy one to describe, because there were so many different solutions, almost as many as there were serious thinkers in the period. Mancinelli is writing on the eve of the Reformation, when many intellectuals were dissatisfied with the corruption of the church and their relative inability to effect reforms. Manicnelli,however, seems to have been a pretty conformist type. He is very devoutly religious and does not seem to have felt there was any real or necessary break between classical scholarship and Christian orthodoxy. I suspect this was a common stance among humanists, especially those of the second rank. It is worth remembering in this regard that, although I have devoted an entire chapter to him, Mancinelli was not one of the great thinkers of the period.

Of course there are examples such as that of Martin Luther who used the written word to express discontent with the censorship of the established church, but were there any measures in place to ensure that what was printed was not used to deceive the masses? The advent of technology that rapidly diffuses information seems to me as a double edged sword, with those whose agenda includes actually spreading useful knowledge with others whose agenda includes falsification of major historical events, revisions to fit a prescribed world view, etc. It seems as though with the cost of owning or running a printing machine, only the elite had the opportunity to spread knowledge, possibly to the detriment of others. As always with technology there is this potential for benefit or hinderance, and I'm wondering what other downsides, if any, there were to the introduction of print? (other than printing errors) I'm mostly thinking along the lines of how rewriting information by hand and story telling are two very effective ways to memorize information rather than simply reading printed words on a page and memorizing, which may lead to pacification in smaller tutoring style settings</p>","excerpt":"Hi Dr. Gehl, I may have missed it in another section, but I was wondering if there were any institutions or bodies that regulated what was printed/diffused?

Local governments could keep surveillance on and regulate local trade, but there were no systems to extend that control very far. Printing eventually spawned many attempts at press regulation and censorship, but, as Luther's case demonstrates, it was not at all effective in the fifteenth and early sixteenth century; and even later, you just had to go to the next town with a willing printer to get something into print. Control of the market for school books was more effective in the sense that teachers had to approve what was used, but there was a lot of competition. The only case of a textbook that was really widely imposed is described in Chapter 5 below, for the Jesuit schools, and even there some teachers did not conform entirely.</p>","excerpt":"To start with your last remark first, Khalil: Some commentators at the time insisted that having print copies so easily available would make memorizing less necessary and they worried about its effects.

But even scholars in the filed who might comment once on first reading will not comment on later readings, merely cite and go on to something else. By contrast to some e-fiction and music which is intended to grow via additions from an audience, the audience for a monograph is mostly static.

Very soon thereafter, however, the educational program of the humanists began to decline in status from a cultural near-monopoly into a strongly held but increasingly minority point of view. These events transpired almost entirely in print; they represent a struggle that played out in publishing houses and bookstores as well as in classrooms. This book relates a small but important part of the humanist adventure, the story of how the humanists sold their program to the public through educational publishing in Italy across the long sixteenth century (ca.1450 to ca.1650).</p>\n<p>Since publishers and booksellers had so much to do with the success of the humanist educational program in schools and in cultural life more generally, I call my study Humanism For Sale. I realize that this title directly challenges one of the most cherished and persistent of humanist commonplaces, that learning cannot be bought and sold. Still, it seems a particularly appropriate way to describe the market for Latin textbooks. Throughout late-Renaissance Europe, largely similar products packaged for use in highly standardized curricula jostled for sales by advertising connections, real or imagined, with the greatest humanist celebrities. My title also points in the direction of the future of educational publishing. Latin-trained intellectuals constantly had to resell the elitist ideals of humanism to a broad public of politicians, churchmen, and businessmen. Marketing was increasingly a key to literary success.</p>\n<p>The book proceeds topically, discussing a few textbooks and writers in some depth and treating many others briefly because they were typical of certain kinds of pedagogical needs and market considerations. An introduction describes the methodological issues and exemplifies the kinds of voices that offer evidence for textbook making and use. Chapters one and two exemplify the fate of classical and medieval school authors as they evolved into print textbooks. Chapter three follows the career of a single humanist teacher and author of textbooks. There follow two chapters devoted to specific portions of the market for textbooks by non-Italian authors. They tell the complex story of a generalized resistance in the Italian market to Northern authors even as Italian publishers took advantage of the fame of these same humanists to advertise Italian textbooks. The two final chapters concern the future of textbook publishing in the sixteenth century. They treat the growth of vernacular teaching texts and the new genre of the emblem book. Books of these sorts took their start from the moral and intellectual ideals of humanism but quickly evolved into harbingers of a European culture that was nationalistic, expansionistic, and less elitist than Latin education had ever been. (A detailed table of contents with section heads appears on every screen of the on-line text.)</p>\n<p>As a whole then, Humanism For Sale moves from the \"translation\" of traditional manuscript schoolbooks into print toward their replacement in some fields by books with other goals and concerned with subjects the humanists did not stress. I have confined my study to educational publishing and so have not written a history either of publishing or of education. But the field in which these two histories intesect has broad implications for our understanding of the Renaissance -- not in its origins, but in its future, that is, in the way it evolved into a European cultural norm.</p>","excerpt":"During the fifteenth century, Europeans witnessed the triumph of the cultural movement we call humanism.

It retains its original structure in traditional chapters, listed in the Table of Contents. You can also link to a variety of special themes. Here are the major ones:\nHumanism developed as an educational program for the Italian elites. It was based on the revival of good Latin grammar, style, and literature. Soon after printing was invented (around 1450), humanists adopted the new technology as the best way to teach, to present scholarly research, and to publicize their program. It is hard to hear the voices of students in the surviving textbooks (some are very rare) and archival sources, but we can hear the teachers speak at length and sometimes movingly about their work.</p>\n<p>Humanists and their publishers took all kinds of earlier book forms, experimented with how to use them in the classroom, and eventually created the modern textbook. They tried various innovations with the design of the page, with types, and with color. They also experimented with different kinds of print marketing, finding readers for their new textbooks and competing with each other for an international market. For this they worked on title page layout and advertising prose, on prefaces, and on other kinds of teaching aids.</p>\n<p>Educational conservatism was strong, however, and many medieval school texts continued to be used, especially with younger students. Traditional texts like these were often presented by printers in very traditional designs that mimicked medieval school books. Conservatism also meant that many textbook markets remained local or regional, with opportunities for a prominent teacher to author and sell books to several generations of his own students. Starting in the 1570s, the Jesuits reformed education at all levels and created their own textbooks for use in schools throughout Europe and even in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. These were the first truly international textbooks.</p>\n<p>As humanism declined across the following centuries, it became a minority point of view, but other thinkers and educators used the design and marketing innovations of Latin school teachers. Schoolbooks in the vernacular languages became common only in the 1530s, at a time when many skills once reserved to the Latin-educated were popularized for others. Elementary math books were the earliest to appear in Italian, already before 1500. Reading and writing books appeared first in the 1510s and 1520s. How-to books and emblem books also became popular in the early sixteenth century. Music and geography had specialized textbooks and separate markets.</p>\n<p>Before long, I hope to link to other general-interest subjects, listed below. Keep in mind they will usually be discussed in the context of a detailed research study, but you may find useful hints for further reading in the footnotes and bibliography.</p>\n<p>Literacy\nCelebrity authors\nManuscript Books\nMoral Education</p>","excerpt":"Humanism For Sale was originally written as a specialized scholarly book, but I decided to present it to a broader audience in the form of a website plus blog.

It is a richly illustrated monograph on the design and marketing of schoolbooks that explores the activities of humanist teachers in the increasingly commercialized book markets of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p>\n<p>When first published, <em>Humanism For Sale</em> employed blogging software to allow readers to interact with its author, book historian and Newberry curator Paul F.

Scholarly readers and students offered many comments, which are preserved in the present version. Closed to further comment in early 2019, it remains the most comprehensive treatment of its subject currently available.

It indulges the usual hubris of the self-published author, but without the additonal vanity of a book on paper that few people really want. To compensate for the lack of paper, I have tried to make it as approachable as possible via the electronic means available to me.</p>\n<p>Obviously, what we lose in self-publishing of the sort is peer review and the stamp of approval that the traditional university press book offers. What we gain is a dynamic object that can be revised and improved via dialogue with the interested public. Moreover, we can hope for more than one public. I am an historian, but I wrote this book while immersed in the life of a research library and within the lively design community of Chicago, as well as in the more traditional world of academic history. So I am hoping for a broader public than I could get for a book published, cataloged, and shelved in one place in a library, as some infitessimal subset of early modern intellectual history.</p>\n<p>In the interests of full disclosure, I should point out that <em>Humanism For Sale</em> was conceived as a scholarly history book with an American university press in mind. As such it failed to find a publisher. The reasons given me were purely economic -- there is no market for so specialized a book. Rather than pursue other kinds of peer-reviewed publishing, I have continued to work on the manuscript and have re-conceived it for publication as you see it now, a website with a blog that will invite feedback and futher revision.</p>\n<p><em>Humanism For Sale</em>, then, has not had peer review in the traditional sense. Friends and colleagues have read all of it in one form or another, and I have profited from their criticism. I submit it now to the futher review of my peers in history, but also to many who know some of this material better than I do, from points of view I do not have, and with expertise I do not claim.</p>\n<p>I'm afraid <em>Humanism For Sale</em> still looks and works a lot like a traditional book. But given the potential of the blog, this \"book\" can get better as time passes, something a published volume cannot do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/cv\">Curriculum Vitae of Paul F.

Manfurio does not speak in the literary Italian of his day, nor even in the colorful Neapolitan of some other characters in the play. His every sentence is a macaronic mix of Latin and vernacular, indulging in philological niggling and meaningless etymological digression. In a single brief speech, he can display slavish imitation of classical authors, apply a textbook commonplace badly, and claim a false intellectual pedigree:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>MANFURIO: Oh! Eliminate that <em>nequam</em>, for although the word is used in Scripture, it is in no way Ciceronian. \"Living well, follow only the most learned men,\" says the Ninevite Giovanni Despauterio, followed in this by my praeceptor Aloisio Antonio Sidicino Sarmento Salano, successor to Lucio Giovanni Scoppa.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This kind of meaningless bluster, according to Bruno, was a common result of the standard humanist education of his day. <em>Latinitas</em> (Latin-ness) had been a cherished ideal of humanists for two centuries. But for Bruno it was no longer a goal; it was a fussy pretense. Humanism was all puffery and salesmanship. (1)</p>\n<p>During the fifteenth century, Europeans witnessed the triumph of the <em>studia humanitatis</em>, the cultural program we call humanism. Soon thereafter, however, they saw this same educational philosophy decline in status from a cultural near-monopoly into a powerful but increasingly minority point of view, easily satirized by Bruno and many others. Humanism's slow rise took place in a manuscript world, but its rapid triumph and decline transpired almost entirely through the new medium of print. In this online book I relate a small but important part of the Italian adventure in humanism, the story of how humanists sold their program to the public through educational publishing across the long sixteenth century (that is, the period from about 1450 to 1650 or so). My subject is school books, or, to use a modern term that describes the end result of these two centuries of publishing history, textbooks. My study, however, is neither a history of education in the period nor properly a history of printing and bookselling. Both printing and pedagogy have their own extensive histories. (2) Instead, I have chosen to plough a sizeable but I hope manageable field in which these two vast and varied landscapes intersect, namely the specific methods and problems of textbook publishing in the first two centuries of printing. The project is important if only because schoolboys and their teachers were so important a segment of the book market in the first years of printing. (3)</p>\n<p>From 1450 to 1650, the open intellectual inquiry that humanists promoted slowly led to the demise of their monopoly on learning. The period witnessed both the invention of new kinds of school books and the decline of the educational system that produced them. The protagonists of this history are teachers, printers, publishers, and booksellers. Students will appear as well, but their voices are relatively little attested. Textbook publishing worked from the top down, in hierarchical terms that seemed natural to educators of the period. Renaissance teachers, like their medieval predecessors, did most of the</p>\n<p>There were also many forces at work in the sixteenth-century classroom that came from outside the schools. The mass production of printed textbooks and the increasingly creative role of publishers and booksellers in marketing them introduced tensions into the supposedly \"natural\" relationship between master and student. These middlemen had a voice that was increasingly urgent. Often they insisted that authors speak in terms that advertised their books, for publishers could now measure the success of a given textbook baldly in sales figures. Marketing, then, is a major part of the history recounted here.</p>\n<p>The teachers we can hear are largely humanists, men who taught in the Latin schools, though in chapters six and seven we will meet some others. At the start of our period in Italy, most teachers, certainly most of the authors of new textbooks, had had some education to humanist ideals. By the end, the educational theories of the humanists were almost universally accepted. But many medieval texts were in use in Italian schools in 1450. The force of tradition meant that some of these, especially at the most elementary level of Latin instruction, would remain in the hands of students right through the seventeenth century. It will be necessary, then, to consider both the conservative force of educational tradition and the ways in which authorship and pedagogy changed under market pressures. For the latter part of the period in question, we must also consider the effect of the Reformation on publishing and education alike. In this same period, general economic conditions -- both a long-term and large-scale decline in economic activity in Italy and short-term disruptions caused by political unrest, natural disaster, and war -- had negative effects on competition. Under these conditions, a few large firms flourished and dominated important sectors of the book market. But textbook publishing remained an exception in this regard; many small publishers jostled on the market with unoriginal and even shoddy products. (4)</p>\n<p>Since bookselling had so much to do with the success of the humanist educational program, in schools as in cultural life more generally, I call my study <em>Humanism For Sale</em>. I realize that this title directly challenges one of the most cherished and persistent of humanist commonplaces, that learning cannot be bought and sold. Even today, as Robert Lopez put it in a classic essay, \"The dirty boots of the economist are notoriously unwelcome on the polished floors of humanistic mansions.\" (5) In the sixteenth century, similar, commonplace prejudices were in effect. A highly-developed sense of honor led many humanists to insist on subsidizing their own books to keep them from becoming merely venal. The practice was so widespread as to distort markets entirely in some places. (6) Still, <em>Humanism For Sale</em> seems a particularly appropriate way to describe the market for Latin textbooks. Throughout late-Renaissance Europe, largely similar products packaged for use in highly standardized curricula competed for sales by advertising connections with humanist celebrities. Even conservatively chosen and framed works inherited from the Middle Ages and repackaged for sixteenth-century schools relied on associations with well-known educators. Classicizing <em>fama</em> increasingly turned into market-driven celebrity. (7)</p>\n<p>My title also points toward the future of educational publishing. While humanist philology emphasized slow, critical work on ancient and traditional texts, the educational market (and other forms of popularization) pulled authors in the opposite direction, toward confecting entirely new texts that could be quickly delivered and frequently reprinted. (8) Latin-trained intellectuals constantly had to resell the elitist ideals of humanism to a public of politicians, churchmen, and influential businessmen. This was as true at the beginning of our period, when humanism was still a relatively new movement, as at the end, when Latin, even in its seeming moment of triumph, was beginning to lose ground, eventually to become the shibboleth of a superseded cultural ideal. (9) Marketing was increasingly a key to literary success in early modern Europe, and humanism was only as successful as its market was broad and deep.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(1) I, v; I have adapted the translation of Gino Moliterno, Bruno 2000, 80.

There was no single history of educational publishing in Italy at the period. Textbook authors and publishers often had large ambitions, but textbook markets were largely local and regional. (10) Every city and town had teachers with needs the new technology of printing could address. Even the publishing histories of some highly popular textbooks break up, after a first or second edition, into separate histories of their exploitation in different local or regional markets. Chapter five will explore one international publishing success; but we will find that even the highly centralized Jesuit order had difficulty unifying the curriculum in its Italian schools.</p>\n<p>We may recognize four aspects to this Italian textbook regionalism. First, printers respected and continued certain practices of manuscript production for the schools. In traditional pedagogy, every teacher was to some degree an author of the texts he used. Even texts in longstanding use were modified at almost every copying for the specific needs of a given classroom. (11) Teachers in the first age of print were unwilling to relinquish this sovereign power to customize texts, even though the easy availability of printed textbooks encouraged the opposite behavior, standardization. Teachers could at every period create local, miniature markets. Perhaps the most extreme case in sixteenth-century Italy was that of Evenzio Pico, a grammar master who spent his career teaching in Ancona and published one textbook in a single edition directed entirely at a market of his own students. (12)</p>\n<p>Secondly, the humanist pedagogy in its ascendancy just as print came along emphasized the use of classroom texts as sources of imitative composition. An essential tool of such pedagogy was paraphrase, a classroom practice that promoted the instability of texts by encouraging readers at all levels to rewrite texts repeatedly, often phrase by phrase. Erasmus (ca. 1466-1536) was an influential exponent of this sort of mimetic paraphrase, but he did not invent it. It was a commonplace of humanist pedagogy and it contributed to the fragmentation of markets for textbooks. (13) We will discover a revolt against this practice in the mid-sixteenth century, but one that emphasizes how commonly teachers expected to rewrite textbooks for local use, even those that represented editions of classic texts.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, educational conservatism, a constant in every period, meant that even the most obvious and salutary reforms of textbooks were adopted only slowly. New titles relied on the marketing power of their authors, and old ones continued in use in some schools long after they had gone out of general use. Even before 1400, humanist writers started to complain about the <em>Doctrinale</em> of Alexander of Villa Dei (1175-1240); but it was the best selling intermediate grammar of the fifteenth century and was still in use in some schools in the early seventeenth century. In other markets, as we will see, self-consciously archaic textbooks -- medievalizing in content and design -- were offered as alternatives to what some teachers and parents saw as over-moder</p>\n<p>Lastly, marketers often chose to publish local authors as such, either because they had some local reputation as fine teachers, or because there was some advertising value in their status as local celebrities. Perugia had a particularly strong market of this sort. The city's most famous humanist was Francesco Maturanzio (1443-1518), whose works were published Europe-wide, but who also had a local reputation that ensured he would be reprinted at Perugia into the seventeenth century. A century later, Marcantonio Bonciari (1555-1616) had a similar if smaller publishing fame, centered in Perugia but extending to Rome and Venice. A different fate awaited Maturanzio's student Cristoforo Sassi (1499-1574), who was professor of rhetoric at Perugia. His grammatical textbook got at least twelve editions in the latter half of the sixteenth century, but it could not really be considered influential since the book did not succeed in Venice or Rome. (15) Sassi was published mostly at Florence, where he could be considered a Tuscan celebrity.</p>\n<p>Modena, by contrast to Perugia, had no very lively publishing tradition. A grammarian there like Giovanni Briani (active 1570-1600) could not hope for even the regional reputation of Sassi. Briani's entire output was printed at Modena. Neither his original Latin grammar nor a primer he edited ever got a second printing. Books like Briani's were probably not true market products all; they aimed at use in a single school. In economic terms they were subsidized, non-competitive products like many other humanist publications. In some cities, moreover, the progress of the Counter-Reformation worked to encourage the purchase of local (and locally censored) books in preference to those imported from outside Italy or even from suspiciously heterodox Venice.

Every early modern reader brought unique experiences to the individual copy he or she picked up. The reading each individual gave a book can sometimes be studied, but it can rarely be pronounced typical. This degree of variation obtained in the manuscript age and remained the case in the age of printing. The mass production of books does not mean that we have to do with a different kind of reading history. The invention of printing merely changed the history of some singular readings into a history of many, many singular readings, complicating the problem of generalization. (17) Educational publishing in the sixteenth century, then, must be understood to embrace numerous exceptions to the few apparent rules. Even in so narrowly defined a field, publishing ideals and practices varied greatly and progressed unevenly. From most modern points of view early modern publishers acted inconsistently, even erratically. Then too, some one hundred fifty different texts in well over two thousand different editions were produced in Italy during this period specifically for the use of teachers and students in the single area of Latin grammar. I cannot claim to have read all these texts or even to have seen them all, far less to have examined all the editions, sometimes many dozens, of individual texts. (18) Trying to account for every text or even most of them would give a picture so blurred as to be unreadable.</p>\n<p>Still, some sorts of reading are easier to study than others and educational reading is one of them. (19) We can evaluate the meanings individual textbooks had when there were many editions in large print runs and when there are sources that allow us to describe the classrooms in which these books were used. Classroom use is by its nature less singular than private reading because it is the moment when groups of students are learning how to read, a skill they will employ life-long. As they grow intellectually readers employ these skills with increasing degrees of individualism. In the classroom they are more likely to act like each other. Thus, the classroom affords us a window on groups of readers, but it does not always give us a clear view. Textbook history is always limited because the evidence, overwhelmingly the textbooks themselves, cannot unambiguously reveal how those books were used. At best, Renaissance textbooks offer a limited view of how they were probably intended to be used.</p>\n<p>Another tricky problem concerns what evidence has come down to us and what is simply lost. Elementary textbooks, especially grammars and arithmetics, have a very low rate of survival. (20) A few telling examples will serve to measure the problem. We know that the most widely used basic Latin textbook in Renaissance Italy, the Donat (erroneously ascribed to the late ancient author Aelius Donatus), had many printings. Some thirty separate editions are known from fifteenth-century Italy, but only a few of these editions survive in more than a single copy. A similar rate of survival characterizes editions of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with the added problem that catalogs and bibliographies for the later period are much less complete than for the fifteenth century. The rare survivors, our only evidence for the publishing history of this important and common text, are scattered in libraries across Europe and the Americas, and we will never know how many editions were made that do not come down to us at all.</p>\n<p>By way of corollary, one innovative elementary textbook of the fifteenth century, a reworking of the Donat, purportedly by the Roman humanist Pomponio Leto (1428-1498), is known in a single copy of an edition apparently printed after the author's death. Leto's achievement remains a footnote in the history of humanist education because it had no practical effect on other writers or teachers. His little reform grammar was published, but it had no publishing history. (21) Another great humanist of Leto's time, Giorgio Valla (1447-1500), also wrote a Latin grammar, in this case a lengthy, systematic treatment which appeared in his posthumously published encyclopedia entitled <em>A Work on Things to be Pursued and Those to be Avoided</em> (1501). In 1514, the three books on grammar were excerpted from the larger work and published as a separate volume, ostensibly offered for school use. But there is no evidence it ever reached the hands of students. The book is very rare and we have no way of knowing why. Most likely it was printed speculatively in a small run and did not find enough of an audience to merit a reprint.</p>\n<p>Still another methodological problem concerns terminology. Teachers and publishers in the long sixteenth century possessed no standard or uniform vocabulary with which to describe textbooks, a fact aggravated further by the humanist habit of looking for original, striking, or elegant expressions. Their titles could be grand or humble, largely without reference to the audience the author had in mind or the physical size or shape of the book. Even terms that would seem to indicate a specific kind of treatment or level of instruction can be deceiving. As a result it is often possible to judge the level of a given text and its intended audience only after a physical examination of multiple editions.

But Cittadella's book runs to only forty pages in small octavo. It is so rare there is no real hope of comparing copies. There is almost no evidence of how it was used except the author's preface, which simply says it is an introductory work that will be followed by a longer and more detailed one, apparently never published.

It was usually presented in a single quarto-sized gathering of ten or twelve leaves, crowded with type in several sizes employed to specifications by De Spauter himself. It got many dozens of printings in this format between the first edition of 1514 and the end of the sixteenth century. Often it stood as the first work among several at the same basic level in collections. De Spauter was the most talked-about textbook author of his day, so we know a great deal about how the *Rudimenta *was used. But in 1537, Robert Estienne at Paris included the <em>Rudimenta</em> in a folio collected works of enormous dimensions for a textbook (nearly 33 cm.).

As such they point up how textbooks could be more than popularizations for students. They were also important loci of intellectual debate among humanists.

Only rarely, mostly in drilling books, can we actually hear teachers lecture or students recite. Moreover, if there is a single, general movement across the chapters below, it is from the textual toward the visual both in pedagogical terms and in design and printing technique. This movement mirrors a development towards the increasing visualization of information in European culture more generally and the tendency to entrust information ever more to printing and design professionals. (32) However, early modern teachers did not attempt to separate textual from visual literacy. On the contrary, much that is interesting about the schoolbooks of the day derives from their insistence upon the visual nature of all learning and on visualization as a universal intellectual technique. Renaissance schoolmasters inherited the rhetorical, psychological, and pedagogical models for this insistence from medieval memory theorists and practitioners. (33) Printing intensified this aspect of education, because it allowed teachers to put carefully designed visual models into the hands of every school child and many adults, who thereafter owned those images personally in the form of books they would keep life long.</p>\n<p>Printing also allowed for the display of texts in visually compelling packages. One example is Erasmus's <em>On Eloquence (De Copia)</em>, a compilation of commonplace phrases for composition. Erasmus's book was transformed several times by teachers and printers who wandered far from the author's original intent. First it was enlarged and redesigned, then abbreviated, and still later put into tabular form. (34) Similarly, editorializing and typography altered some popular Latin grammars well beyond anything their ostensible authors could have recognized. In the case of emblems and almost contemporaneously in handwriting instruction manuals, printing as a design technology made possible entirely new genres of book. Like many other things in the history of the book, the design changes wrought by printing were immense in quantitative terms but developed qualitatively only gradually, sometimes through collaborations by authors and printers and sometimes independently of the efforts (and wishes) of teachers. Tracing design changes in some detail, therefore, has been a primary concern of mine.</p>\n<p>Throughout this online book, I have also been concerned with marketing issues, because these are genuinely new considerations in the age of print. This bias again reflects my sense that early modern culture was profoundly visual. The invention of printing multiplied the number of books and prints in the world and thereby altered irrevocably the market for ideas. It created mass-produced printed objects for every phase of life, every social class, every age group. One of the more immediate results of the printing revolution was the appearance in multiples and ubiquitously of the word on public display, not just in churches, schools, and libraries where medieval people encountered public words, but also in homes, shops, taverns, theaters, city streets and squares, even at rural roadsides.</p>\n<p>Images, of course, had always been labeled and often incorporated words in antiquity and in the Middle Ages. In learned circles the ekphrastic evocation of a work of art was a recognized literary genre. But the medieval public for images was immensely larger than the public for written words. Literacy rates were just too low for images to function widely with written accompaniment. Printing, it seems, not only made for increases in literacy (erratically, it is true, but inevitably); it also made it useful to pair almost every image with words -- words that explained or labeled objects, words that teased or intrigued viewers, and words that sold the ideas and images to which they were attached. (35) Textbook publishing could not but be directly involved in this change and was perhaps more susceptible to it than other fields of printing. For textbooks were the tools with which both elite and common folk learned to decipher the abundance of new words and images around them.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(32) Useful discusssions in McKenzie 1989, 104-106; Cahn 1994, 53-57; Crosby 1997, 129-137, 227-238; Coppens 2005, 34-37; Follak 2007, 155-157.</li>\n<li>(33) Carruthers 1990, 229-257 and 1998, 135-142; B.

His more basic schoolbook, <em>Ten Chapters On Grammar</em>, had more modest success both North and South of the Alps.

(38) The marketers of a 1508 Milan edition of Negro's grammar included a successful commercial printer, Gottardo da Ponte, and a printer/publisher, Leonardo Vegio, whose name appears on many humanist textbooks. Vegio gave his public an unusual amount of specific, flattering information about Negro in the conventional humanist form of a letter to the young son of a wealthy and powerful patron. Vegio started by naming the present Milanese printer, a locally recognized figure:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since Gottardo da Ponte, citizen of Milan, well knows that among all those who have written on Latin grammar in our day none is more renowned than Francesco Negro, he [Da Ponte] has again contracted to us for printing the highly useful <em>Grammatical Precepts</em> at a distance of twenty-eight years from its first careful edition. ... This book leads a boy from the very cradle of letters all the way to poetic mastery and to the high point of oratory. If you study it well and work hard at it ... you will have progressed as it were in both virtue and letters, which is true nobility. (39)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Despite the humanist veneer, this is pure advertising. It was no small claim to say that Negro was the most famous grammarian of his age, especially since his reputation was in fact waning by 1508. Moreover, the exaggerated commonplaces commending the book also contain specific claims that it contains a comprehensive course. The detail that it was printed twenty-eight years back might seem to imply that it has been out of print for all the intervening years, but in fact there were at least four editions outside of Italy between the first printing of 1480 and this one, and it had appeared at Milan just a year earlier from Vegio's own press with a preface closely similar to this one. Vegio was making a different, and perhaps riskier claim, that he was setting out to remedy the book's relative absence from the market despite its author's fame.</p>\n<p>The preface indulged another humanist motif we will see repeatedly, that the book was being produced in the present moment for the use of a single, well-born student. This commonplace evoked the ideal that humanists worked as private tutors to great aristocratic families and composed their textbooks for a few beloved students. But Vegio's preface also made the more printerly claim that this textbook can accompany any student from his first study of letters to finished eloquence in poetry and prose. The publisher seems to vacillate between saying that the book was a good old-fashioned one, thus admitting that it might be a bit passÃ©, and claiming that it merited a large market for its broad scope and erudition.</p>\n<p>So much for the publisher's foreword. The book is also dressed up with a fulsome preface and an equally wordy afterword by the author. By contrast to his unapologetic promoters, Negro himself affected the affable humility and patience of a good Christian humanist. He also assumed that the field of grammar was nastily competitive. These themes, which follow ancient and medieval models, would remain characteristic of printed grammars. (40) The 1508 author's preface was lifted from the first edition of 1480, so it is a print product; but it was in the form of a pre-publication letter to a noble patron, a Milanese ambassador to Venice. The voice was presented as somehow timeless, and yet it addresses very present-day issues of marketing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore I decided to send to you, excellent man, a brief work of grammar which I recently wrote but which has not yet been disseminated widely. And this is the reason I took up this work: not because I imagined that it would be praised as superior to what has already been written in this field of study by the ancients, or so that I would be compared to them, and even less that anyone should say that I have added anything. For I do not have such temerity or boldness. Rather it was for love of you ... to whom I am indebted. For I recalled to myself how much boys worry their studies at this age. (41)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To this oft-repeated theme of the teacher's compassion for students who had difficulty learning Latin, Negro added an equally conventional concern for the next generation, in this case for his addressee's sons.</p>\n<p>Tropes of parental piety and of the teacher acting <em>in loco parentis</em> were more or less obligatory in humanist pedagogical prefaces. Negro went on, however, to anticipate criticism for his ambition and for the success of his work on the market:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have collected into a single brief work all the flowers of the humanities, and I have mapped out a very short road by which a man may easily acquire them, so that he can become learned. But there will be some, perhaps, who will try to denigrate our work, especially since we have stirred up old detractors before its publication and will have acquired new ones as well, all of them, we judge, acting like a swarm of midges who think they can bite an elephant. Let those who would pester our writings be exhorted, however, to read first and attack later. For although there may not be learning enough in me, nor yet a complete understanding of the material (which is perhaps necessary), still that sentiment may apply to me which we read of Apelles in respect to Alexander and of Phidias in respect to Olympian Jove, namely we find that greater praise resulted the greater were those whose models they imitated.

While the basic teaching texts in these books are sources for the history of pedagogy, the front matter, apparatus, and design elements are primary documents for marketing strategy. This is an area where examining as many books, as many editions, and as many copies as possible is a distinct asset. The ways in which a given text is arranged and printed during the lifetime of an author may tell us about his intentions for the text, especially if the resulting layout is unusual or innovative and we can also surmise that the work was done under his supervision. If a text of the sort changes after the apparent involvement of its author ends, we can be even more certain of his involvement in the original case. (44) I have included some clear examples of both these phenomena (Pomponio Leto and Giovanni Cantalicio in chapter two; Antonio Mancinelli in chapter three; Josse Bade and Jan de Spauter in chapter four). In other cases, it seems equally clear that design and marketing innovations were the work of printers or publishers, not of the authors (Tacuino, Rusconi, and Vegio in chapter three; the publishers of Gian Alberto Bossi in chapters two and five). The unique case of Aldo Manuzio (1449 or 50-1515) who was both author and publisher of textbooks, turns out to be less informative than most, since it is not possible to separate his pedagogical and printerly motives. (45)</p>\n<p>Annotations in surviving textbooks offer a particular set of interpretive problems, but they can be as valuable for understanding textbooks as for other kinds of authorship and readership. (46) I have employed them sparingly in this book, primarily to explicate how the marketing of some books seems to have been reflected in actual classroom usage. In other words, the annotations of students and teachers can be a test of the effectiveness of the often extravagant claims made on title pages or in prefaces. As Kristian Jensen has noted, most annotated schoolbooks that survive bear marks made by teachers not students, no doubt because teachers and institutions were more likely than individual pupils to reuse books from year to year, to have them bound, and to save them. Annotated schoolbooks, then, tend to witness the opinions and practices of a professional class of humanists struggling to make do with the textbooks they found on the market.

(48) Again, a single example will stand for the problems of the class. A copy of Niccolò Perotti's highly successful <em>Rudimenta grammatices</em> printed at Venice in 1478 and now at the Newberry Library is not particularly heavily annotated, but the contemporary and near-contemporary notes it does bear are of the most varied sort.

These various notes take us from the grammar school classroom to a private study, then to a university setting, and on to a tradesman's shop.

Schoolmasters frequently decided to publish their own classroom materials, often, it would seem, with little ambition beyond the guaranteed local market of their own students. These strictly local products embody the same tricks of the teacher's trade that we find repeatedly in the margins of widely used books. They are evidence for the reading and teaching habits of their authors, and also for their dissatisfaction with received textbooks. As the sixteenth century progressed, moreover, a whole new genre of Latin textbook came into existence based on the kind of annotations we find in schoolbooks. This was the vocabulary drill book based on a specific classical author whose works were used in intermediate grammar school courses. Cicero was the author most often treated in this way. Apparently these drill books were intended in part to relieve the basic grammar course of the elaborate vocabulary study that had come to burden it in the late fifteenth century. Teachers could defer study of specialized vocabulary until the intermediate course when students would encounter these words while reading the standard authors.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(44) On methodological issues, McKenzie 1989, 104-106; McKenzie 2002, 123-136; 206-223.</li>\n<li>(45) See chapter two for a brief discusion of this point.</li>\n<li>(46) Jardine 1993, 137-141; Milde 1998, 7-9; Hellinga 1998, 135-138; Jackson 2001, 9-15, 244-258; G?ombiowski 2002, 45-60; McKenzie 2002, 144-146; Ruffini 2002, 156-157.</li>\n<li>(47) Jensen 1991.</li>\n<li>(48) Hellinga 1988, 137-138.</li>\n<li>(49) Perotti 1478, copy at the Newberry Library, Chicago.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Beyond such advertising prose, it is important to look for other evidence in surviving textbooks -- layout and design, paper and type choices, ownership marks and annotations.

Increasingly publishers were betting on a large existing demand, on a ready market for new textbooks, or on their ability to create demand through advertising. (50)</p>\n<p>In some ways, textbooks, particularly the perennial favorites inherited from the Middle Ages, were ahead of the market in this regard because at every period some of them could be produced cheaply for students every printer knew were out there. Even in the early years of printing, when teachers did not expect every student to have a textbook in hand, they could see the value of doing so if the text was an old standard and the booklet in question was cheap enough.

The risks could be minimized by having a successful teacher as collaborator, since he could guarantee that his present and future students would buy the books. Sometimes these teachers also provided part of the cash needed to capitalize the venture, while in other cases, printers or their backers undertook all the financial risk on speculation that the reputation of a well-known teacher would create a market. This latter case was particularly likely for university-level textbooks, where the investment was large but the authors were genuine celebrities. Local grammar masters in the fifteenth century had less fame, so they often had to participate financially themselves if they wished to publish new and untried works. In the sixteenth century it was rarer for teachers to invest, but there are probable cases as late as the fifteen forties.

In the humanities, textbook authors recapitulated that portion of \"yesterday's learning that was to be learned by tomorrow's male adults.\" (52) Thus, insofar as this online book is a study of how textbooks were used, it falls into the category of what Roger Chartier, writing of popular culture, calls \"appropriation studies\" -- a history of \"the concrete conditions and processes that construct meaning\" in the marketplace for books. This approach involves its own set of methodological cautions, especially the need to resist seeing a small number of surviving cases as typical of whole classes of readers. (53) Here too, however, the educational setting provides us with a control of sorts on the quality of our generalizations. Classrooms, especially elementary ones, were settings for highly deliberate popularizations of learned culture. The strategies teachers incorporated into the textbooks they authored were exactly the ones they expected their students to employ in appropriating learned culture for their personal use later in life. They represent, if you will, the teachers' imagination of the students' appropriational acts. The design elements of such books often reflect these appropriational acts directly. Both students' and teachers' annotations in turn represent direct reactions to the expectations built into textbooks. A thoughtfully annotated textbook or a group of them can offer subtle and complex evidence for a whole range of authorial, editorial, marketing, and readerly appropriations.</p>\n<p>Latin grammar, although it belonged to an international publishing world, was too hidebound and traditional a field to give us a full picture of the dynamics of educational publishing, even in the early sixteenth century. For one thing, the future of textbook publishing lay (as we now recognize) in the creation of national, not international markets. Again, the most innovative textbook printing of the period happened in fields where authors wanted to present entirely new knowledge or highly practical skills to young readers. Geography and astronomy were fields where new advances were made almost yearly in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century and where there was a constant tension between a respect for classical learning and Christian tradition on the one hand, and, on the other, the realization that the ancients had gotten many things seriously wrong. Vernacular literacy also allowed for new kinds of textbooks and new publics for these old subjects. Mathematics and music are telling in this regard, moving as they did from highly theoretical presentations to more practical ones across our period. Handwriting books, by contrast, grew across the sixteenth century from simple models of calligraphy with a few instructions into elaborate self-help books and even systematic treatises aimed at the professional education of scribes or secretaries. We will have repeated recourse to the evidence of books in these fields and will discuss them as a group in chapter six.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(52) Hamilton 2003, 8.</li>\n<li>(53) Chartier 1995, 88-97.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"As David Hamilton points out, textbooks both \"mediate the structure of knowledge on the one hand, and the performance of teaching on the other.\" They assemble knowledge and also organize it for educational purposes.

The Newberry's John M. Wing Foundation on the History of Printing had been abuilding for some thirty years. The library's officers wanted to know how it measured up to comparable collections and what should be their next step in developing it. Among general observations about the existing collection and the market for antiquarian books that would likely feed its expansion, Bauer made several concrete recommendations, among them this one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...a collection destined to illustrate the history and development of the printing craft cannot be governed from an exclusively aesthetic point of view. A collection like Wing should be able to exemplify the real output of the printing press [and] the changing conditions and achievements of the trade in the course of time and in various countries.... In this line ... a collection showing the various perceptions of one dramatic work could be imagined. Terence would probably be the most convenient topic. (1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This opinion was seconded by Stanley Morison. Now, more than fifty years on, it is hard to imagine a world in which the second-century B.C.E. Roman comedian Terence had been printed so frequently and in so many formats as to be representative of \"the real output of the printing press\" over the long term, and harder still to imagine that Morison, Bauer, and the Newberry librarians could believe that so ancient and minor a text would provide useful specimens of everyday printing into the distant future. But the grip of Latin language and culture was still powerful in those immediate postwar years, and indeed the destruction of libraries in the second World War had led to a strong conservationist mentality in the Anglo-American book world. The great Latin authors seemed to be among the eternal verities worth saving for the future. (2)</p>\n<p>However eternal these authors seemed in 1949, they had not always been so. Some esteemed authors had not survived the decline of the Athenian Academy, the fall of the Roman Empire, or the destruction of the great library at Alexandria. Others gained in stature or lost it during the Middle Ages. In the late fifteenth century, it was not at all clear which of the authors of the past were worth saving in the new medium of print. Terence's importance had waxed and waned through the Middle Ages. He did, however, survive the transition to print as well as changes in pedagogy that were in progress in the fifteenth century. Indeed, he was among that century's best sellers.

Any anthology of texts or collection of laws could be an <em>auctor</em>, whether or not the collection to hand was the work of a single author or even of an identifiable one. The scholastic compendium of canon law that achieved universal acceptance as a textbook was indifferently called by its title, <em>Decretum</em>, or by its editor, Gratian, almost from the beginning. It was rarely called and even more rarely cited as \"the <em>Decretum</em> of Gratian\" or by its more descriptive subtitle, <em>Concordance of Discordant Canons</em>. The comparable study-text for theology was the <em>Sentences</em> of Peter Lombard. Although Peter authored other works, this one became so standard that it was cited everywhere as \"the Lombard,\" as if he were the only scholar from that region to write on theology, and as if the historical Peter had made only this one work. Even a highly literary textbook like the fables of Aesop had an author whose name became the title of the book, in large part because he was not in fact the author (in any modern sense) of the text in question but rather its inspiration.(10)</p>\n<p>This habit of mind was universal, and must be kept in mind as we navigate the labyrinth of textbook history. \"Donatus,\" we will discover in a later chapter, was a book more often than an author, and in Italy at least, a book containing texts not authored by the historical grammarian Aelius Donatus. Terence, widely used as a reading text for intermediate students of Latin, was similarly both author and book. The modern question of historical authorship did not apply in this case. Only six plays from the pen of Publius Terentius Afer (d. 159 B.C.E.) survive. They usually circulated as an anthology, and so the textbook Terence was typically the real Terence, or rather, the surviving Terence. Which is not to say that students mastered Terence. In many schools not all six plays were read, or they were not read equally thoroughly. From the twelfth century onward many pseudo-Terentian plays circulated too, taught instead of or alongside the real plays. These were patent imitations and only rarely mistaken for genuine, but they were so widely known that they were Terentian auctores in their own right. They were usually called by their main characters, <em>Pamphilus</em> or <em>Geta</em>, for example. (11)</p>\n<p>The early humanists successfully challenged the mythic world of medieval <em>auctores</em> by distinguishing historical contexts for individual works, by rejecting some sources entirely, and by subjecting all of them to a critique of their language and style. Their work uncoupled textual and literary authority from doctrinal orthodoxy, even from Christian morality. (12) In so doing, they created opportunities for re-thinking the place of certain authors in the elementary and intermediate school curricula. Gradually medieval school <em>auctores</em> became textbook authors in our modern sense of the word. This transformation was wrought over and over in the course of the long sixteenth century, laboriously achieved anew in the case of each ancient or medieval text.</p>\n<p>In this chapter, Terence will serve as a case study for the way Renaissance teachers and publishers transformed school texts from medieval <em>auctores</em> into modern textbooks. These modernized authors were responsible for (but separable from) their textual productions, and the textbook editors were sometimes more important on the market than the authors. Printing, of course, contributed to this phenomenon. The singular manuscript copy of Terence had a weighty authority that hundreds of near-identical Terences would not. The many competing editions that eventually flooded the market created a crisis of authority. But printing was only one dimension of the larger story of recovering the historical authors of antiquity. For our purposes it is more appropriate in any case to speak of the market for print rather than of printing itself, since marketing (more than technology) made the textbook author.</p>\n<p>Terence is a useful case study because the comedies were so widely read, or, more precisely, because teachers so generally claimed to teach them. The textbook Terence, however, has a more complex history than these near-universal claims imply. In some parts of Northern Europe it was to be found in classrooms more or less continuously from the central Middle Ages into the fifteenth century, while in Italy it had gone into eclipse and was re-introduced into the curriculum by the early humanists. By the time printing arrived in Italy, Terence had a regular place in the schools. Its place was sanctioned by the antiquity of the text and the quality of its language, but not by continuous use across many centuries. By contrast to some other reading texts, Terence was a new arrival, a humanist fashion.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(10) The best summary of the complex historical and critical problem of medieval <em>auctoritas</em> and modern authorship is Ascoli 2008, 5-12 and 29-44.

His language had long been held to be the best model for spoken Latin. (4) But the favorite subjects of Terence -- including foolish old men, philandering youths, prostitution, transvestitism, and other forms of trickery -- posed problems for straight laced readers in every age. Most of the humanist opinions that survive are positive, but the context in which we find them suggests that some strongly negative arguments were being made at the same time. In thinking about these Renaissance evaluations of Terence, it is important to distinguish between the relatively radical literary theories of the major humanist thinkers of the first period, writers like Poggio Bracciolini (1380-1459) in his <em>On Avarice</em> and Leonardo Bruni (1369-1444) in <em>Concerning the Study of Literature</em>, on the one hand, and the opinions of humanist pedagogues, from Gasparino Barzizza (ca. 1360-1431) and Guarino Guarini (1374-1460) forward, on the other. Two distinct lines of thought developed about pagan authors; and the two groups of writers rarely took real account of each other. While the more philosophical writers proposed essentially aesthetic criteria for studying classical authors, the teachers stuck to pragmatic, classroom needs and frequently cited traditional medieval notions of the teaching value of authors under discussion. For the pedagogues, poetry was an aesthetic experience, to be sure, but it was also a branch of moral philosophy. Comedy could be studied to learn grammar and style, but even more importantly, it exemplified the virtues and vices in order to demonstrate how best to imitate one and avoid the other. (5)</p>\n<p>We know these issues were debated early in the humanist movement with specific reference to Terence. Several extended defenses of Terence survive from the period 1430-1460 that implicitly cite the opinions of earlier generations. (6) For example, Guiniforte Barzizza (1406-1463), teaching at Novara in the fourteen thirties, may be assumed to have been repeating the opinions of his famous father Gasparino (ca. 1360-1431) when he rendered a complex and nuanced opinion of the value of studying Terence. Guinoforte asserted first that it would be philological negligence to ignore the grammatical and stylistic lessons to be found there. But he added that these lessons cannot be separated from the moral ones:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For those who study [Terence's comedies] carefully to imitate his divine elegance in speaking will also subtly discover the many natures of man, the seriousness of old age with its thrift and severity, the wantonness of youth with its prodigality and unchasteness, the lies of servants, the cunning and deceits of pimps, the arts of prostitutes, and numberless other kinds of behavior. Knowing about these things, they will be able to follow an upright manner of life and will regularly overcome the obstacles they face. (7)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, Antonio Beccaria (ca. 1405-1474) defended poetry in general and Terence in particular in similar terms before an audience assembled by Ermolao Barbaro (1410-1471), bishop of Verona. Beccaria was a student of Vittorino da Feltre (1397-1446) and it is clear that he had he had acquired both his esteem for Terence and also the highly unoriginal themes of his defense in Vittorino's school at Mantua. (8) The life of Terence by Pietro Crinito (1465-ca. 1504), first published in 1505, treated the controversy as essentially settled. Crinito dismissed the detractors of Terence in a single sentence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The great Terence seems to have confirmed this, for this passage in the <em>Adelphi</em> is payback to calumniators who most incite to hate, where the Prologue character says, \"The very thing they esteem a hateful curse, he takes as high praise.\" (9)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Such a dismissal begged all substantive questions, of course, but the passage offers a typically humanist witticism by turning an ancient author's own words about his contemporaries upon his modern detractors. To see how the humanists had come to this rather complacent view of Terence, we must retrace our steps and examine the medieval tradition of using the Roman comedian.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(4) Bloemendal 2003, 32-41.</li>\n<li>(5) Lawton 1972, 15-34; Ronconi 1979, 479-481; Tavoni 1984, 3-72, 105-116; Jensen 1996, 63-67; Tateo 1999, 292-297; Battista Guarino in Kallendorf 2002, 286-289; Bloemendal 2003, 64-68.

Both poets were regularly praised by medieval and Renaissance teachers for the quality of their verse. Both were models for learners from linguistic and literary points of view. But Ovid at most periods was considered a marginal or optional author in schools because of the frankly sexual content of his poems. In medieval schools, the <em>Remedia amoris</em> -- because it was read as a caution against sex -- was more likely to be read with students than even the <em>Metamorphoses</em> with its wealth of useful stories. (13) In Italy there is good evidence that Ovid was studied throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance; but the <em>Heroides</em>, not the other works, particularly appealed to Italian teachers. In the fifteenth century, the less amorous works of Ovid continued to appear in schools, but they were to some degree displaced by revived interest in other poets like Persius and Juvenal. (14)</p>\n<p>Terence, like Ovid, dealt with secular life and sexual innuendo but did not suffer quite the stigma that the frank and explicit Ovid did. Since he wrote verse plays and not lyric poetry, Terence was not a direct rival to Ovid in instructional terms. In Italian schools there is some evidence that Terence was used regularly until the late twelfth century but then fell out of favor. He was read and studied by scholars and used by writers from the time of Dante to the end of the fourteenth century; but the plays were apparently not much used for nearly two hundred years. Regional traditions of advanced study and detailed commentary grew up around important teachers, but there was no commonly used text or commentary throughout Italy. (15)\r\nAround 1400 and in a sustained fashion through the rest of the fifteenth century, all this changed. Terence became one of the most frequently used school authors. This revival must be attributed to the humanist interest in dramatic texts generally and in the long critical tradition that treated Terence as the greatest master of Latin comedy. Humanists praised the varied vocabulary of Terence, his wit, and his supposed appeal to students for well-drawn characters and amusing plots. He was regularly linked in humanist literary opinion to Virgil, apparently in imitation of the judgement expressed in the commentary of Aelius Donatus that these two represent the greatest Latin poetry. Donatus had even opined that Terence was the better and more persuasive writer. Above all, the humanists proposed Terence as the best possible text for students who wished to acquire <em>Latinitas</em>, by which they meant authentic Latin speech patterns. (16) Given the relative frequency with which Terence and Ovid were used in the schools and the humanists' strong teaching interest in Terence, we might expect to find that Terence was the more quickly and widely printed of the two. This was in fact the case, but not by as much as the earlier manuscript tradition might have suggested; and after the very first years of printing the two poets had very different fates, Ovid being the more popular. Furthermore, Ovid was the subject of intense editorial work from the start; while Terence was printed and reprinted in texts so bad that they provoked protest from prominent humanists against printing itself. (17)</p>\n<p>The earliest printing in Italy was dominated by the patronage and interests of humanist-trained churchmen. It was not driven by the needs of school masters. In the very first years (up to 1470), most of the texts published in Italy were religious; the only classical author to be printed immediately was Cicero. The elite humanist groups, however, were involved in a virtual frenzy of Ovidianism by the time printing technology became common around 1470. From a school author occasionally read, Ovid was being transformed into the subject of intense scholarly and literary study. Professional humanists mined the <em>Metamorphoses</em> especially for vocabulary and for mythological references. Writers of all sorts sought out Ovid as a model of refined style both in Latin and Italian, and his mythological characters became principals in the dramatic plots of vernacular plays. (18) Terence by contrast was kid's stuff, literally -- an accepted part of the curriculum for schoolboys but not much imitated by literary writers until the very end of the century.</p>\n<p>It is perhaps no surprise then that in the first full decade of printing in Italy (1470-1479) Ovid received no fewer than eighteen editions with texts curated by humanists of great distinction. There seems to have been a race of sorts in Italy to bring a good, critical Opera omnia into print. In the single year 1471 two rival editions appeared; we do not even now know which was the real first. (19) Moreover, Ovid appeared with increasing frequency in Italy in all sorts of formats as the century went on. In the fourteen eighties twenty-four editions of various works appeared, and in the nineties an astounding thirty eight, so that fully eighty editions appeared before 1500. (20) Contrast this with the French case, where no edition of any Ovidian work appeared until 1495. (21) Clearly, the interest in Ovid was an Italian fashion that created a new market for poetry. The public was hungry.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Terence got a broader immediate reception in print, but a slower critical start and less sustained interest, no doubt because the market was largely educational. The first printed editions (we do not know which was first since they are undated) were made at Strasbourg and Venice about 1470. Other editions followed quickly at Venice, Naples, and Rome. The real burst of activity was in this first decade, when thirty editions appeared in Italy. Already by 1480, a shop in Padua could offer three different Venetian editions, one with commentary labeled \"of the first printing,\" a less expensive one \"of the latest printing,\" and a third, apparently without commentary but \"well printed\" and cheaper still. (22) Later, the pace of reprinting slowed, perhaps because the school market became saturated. There were twenty-two new editions in the fourteen eighties and eighteen in the nineties. (23) As in the case of Ovid, this trend contrasts with that in Northern Europe, where Terence was only rarely printed in the early years of printing but gained in momentum from about 1485 onward. In Italy, while editions with commentaries (and the commentaries themselves) multiplied through the first thirty years, the text of Terence had to wait until the very end of the century for substantial revision.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(13) The <em>Remedia</em> was also far more common than the other minor Ovidian works, Hexter 1986, 18-23.</li>\n<li>(14) Black 2001, 250-253.</li>\n<li>(15) Villa 1984, 217-236; Black 2001, 209, 254-56.</li>\n<li>(16) Villa 1984, 262-276; compare Celenza 2004b, 59.

But another reason for the critical neglect of Terence was the difficulty of emending a text that was already widely available in manuscript. Over seven hundred manuscripts of the comedies survive, by far the largest number dating from the first half of the fifteenth century. The textual tradition was complex, further muddied by the way manuscripts were used in the schools. The plays had long since acquired many notes that derived from local traditions of teaching. As Claudia Villa has described it, Terence was not a stable or simple text, not even a single one, but rather a teaching anthology. She calls this living tradition the <em>lectura Terentii</em>, in which the six plays with their ancient headings and notes were further elaborated by various modern readings. (24) The manuscript tradition of Terence is complicated even more because one version of the text was illustrated, deriving it would seem, from a manuscript assembled in Italy in the fourth or fifth century by one Calliopius. The illustrations display a real or imagined stage production and were known in Northern Europe from Carolingian times onward. (25) The pictures do not appear in most Italian manuscripts and so will concern us only later, when they are reintroduced into Italy in printed form.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/HFS_108.02.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/HFS_108.02.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\"></figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>The mysterious Calliopius, however, was an important part of the textual tradition (and the teaching tradition as well), since he probably acted as editor for the plays in the form they had in the Middle Ages. The functioning of the teaching tradition (Villa's <em>lectura Terentii</em>) may be seen in capsule in the way Calliopius was treated. For most medieval commentators, Calliopius was a famous actor of Terence's time, among those responsible for the production of the plays. This error was a misreading of performance rubrics that accompany the text in Calliopius's redaction; it was repeated from classroom to classroom for centuries. Coluccio Salutati (1331-1406) seems to have been the first to recognize and correct the error, referring to Calliopius as <em>revisor</em> (he meant editor) rather than <em>repetitor</em> (actor). In this small matter as in many others of greater import, humanist scholars inherited a weighty mass of traditional lore about Terence from the medieval schools. (26)</p>\n<p>No wonder, then, that that typical Italian manuscript of Terence is an annotated one. The notes and other apparatus may be elementary and sparse or elaborate and extensive. The text may be presented as prose or verse. The voices of the individual characters may be emphasized by the layout or obscured by it. But it is rare to find a Terence entirely without introduction and annotation. (27) It is fair to say, then, that the Renaissance inherited many Terences and not one, and that the text was hardly ever seen without apparatus that derived from the medieval classroom. The task of sorting out the manuscripts and recovering a single, widely acceptable text was the work of a century and more. Moreover, scholarly work on the text actually ran counter to the much more frequent use of Terence, as a textbook for intermediate study of Latin. The classroom text resisted innovation. Like any textbook, teachers favored the version they already knew. (28)</p>\n<p>The usual manuscript Terence of the Renaissance was a slender but largish paper book in folio form and, from the fourteen thirties onward, in humanist script. The scribe would arrange the text in a single column and leave broad margins to allow for the expected annotations. Since these books were most often teachers' copies, they were relatively unadorned. Their simplicity, however, does not mean that these were graphically unsophisticated manuscripts. In fact they were functional in the extreme. Running heads differentiated the individual plays. The speakers of each part were indicated with sigla in the margin or in red ink within the lines. When the text was presented as verse, it was carefully arranged in typical humanist form with a capital letter at the beginning of each line set out into the left margin. This form was classic for poetry in the humanist classroom, and it presented a fairly stable text of Terence, certainly one that was resistant to extensive change. On the other hand, it was not a form sanctioned by ancient usage. As a widespread model, it only dated from1430 or so when humanist script definitively took over. It conditioned how Terence would con</p>\n<p>The most important Terence manuscript to survive from the ancient world was discovered only in the late fifteenth century. This was the so-called Codex Bembinus of the fifth century, presently Vat. lat. 3226. It is unrelated textually to all the other witnesses, which derive from the recension of Calliopius. The Bembinus takes its name from Bernardo Bembo (d.1519) who acquired it about 1454 from the minor poet Giannantonio de' Pandoni (1405-1485). It does not seem to have gotten much critical use until Agnolo Poliziano (1454-1495) collated it in 1491 with the help of Bernardo's son Pietro Bembo (1470-1547). The younger Bembo later became both a great humanist philologist and a powerful Roman cardinal, patron of other humanists. Poliziano used this source to create a more accurate division of the text into verses and into scenes, clarifying the dramatic structure of the plays. (29)</p>\n<p>The chronology of critical studies on Terence is important for understanding his fortune in print. Many early editions claimed the participation of a humanist editor but it is rarely possible to observe any significant work beyond correcting typographical and other obvious errors. The most specific claims to editorial work were those of Raffaele Regio (1450-1520) for a 1474 edition and Giovanni Britannico of Brescia (1462-1518) in 1485. Their prefaces are those of young humanists who had been offered the chance to exercise their conjectural powers (and make careers) upon Terence. Britannico said that he had made over a thousand changes, a vague and surely exaggerated claim. (30) Only with the work of Poliziano, some thirty years after the first Italian editions, did the humanists begin significant critical editing of the text. By this time scholars already owned a vulgate Terence of sorts, printed and reprinted in dozens of textbook editions. When Poliziano undertook his transcription, he used a printed copy as the base for his collation, one of the many editions in folio that were a staple of the humanist classroom at the period. Other humanists did the same.

These illustrations were based on those in medieval codices discovered and studied by humanists in the fifteenth century. The first illustrated edition was that published by Jean Trechsel at Lyon in 1493. The program of its illustrations is to be attributed to Josse Bade (1462-1535), a Flemish schoolmaster working for Trechsel in the period. Bade also edited the text, as he did for many other schoolbooks, and he provided a preface suggesting the pictures were added for the edification of those illiterate in Latin (presumably those who might hear the plays read aloud from this edition without themselves being able to read Latin with facility). The book was immediately imitated throughout Europe. The first illustrated Italian edition dates from later in the same year, 1493, supervised by Milan printer/publisher Lazzaro Soardi, who reprinted Bade's text and commentary as well as the illustrations. Soardi applied for several privileges from the Venetian authorities to protect his investment in the text, commentaries, and woodcuts. He reprinted the book with additional commentaries into the first decade of the sixteenth century.

These were used and reused by printers across the half-century in which this style of illustration was popular. Typically they consist of one cut per scene with many repeats, to a total of about 150 cuts for the 300-odd scenes in the six plays, plus an author portrait which typically stood at the head of the prologue to each play. Almost all the sequences that survive are close copies of the Trechsel/Bade cuts. (38) Giorgio Rusconi made an attempt to simplify the Trechsel illustrations in 1518. Rusconi created blocks to represent each single character, arranged against a uniform background of drapery. These were assembled in various combinations to represent the persona in each scene.

This was made for an edition published by Giovanni Tacuino of Venice in 1522. In this scheme, each of the six plays was given a comic-strip style series of scenes arranged in two strips of four scenes. There are always just eight cells irrespective of the actual number of scenes in the play. As in the Trechsel scenes, the characters are labeled with abbreviated forms (Pan for Pamphilus, Da for Davus and the like) that anticipate the order of arrival of the characters in the plays. Such scenes in comic-strip form, however, cannot in fact be read as representing the full dramatic action. Indeed it is hard to imagine how they were read at all. At best they functioned as an aide-memoire for a reader who already knew the plot, characters, and major turns of events. This reader could only have been a teacher familiar with the plays, and even he could only use them to help students in the classroom imagine a theater. The Tacuino blocks were used in later editions by Guglielmo de Fontaneta and Venturino Ruffinelli and they were copied at least once in smaller format for a 1526 quarto edition by Alessandro Paganino.

These mimicked the folio manuscripts in humanist script that had already set the format for this text in Italy. Teachers and printers seem to have agreed that this essential school book deserved a handsome dress worthy of a classical author, but they were equally of one mind that it should not be ornamented overmuch. The six canonical plays run to about 6,200 lines of verse, fewer than 100 leaves when set in largish type (typically equivalent to14 point or slightly larger) generously leaded and with wide margins. The commentaries widely available in manuscript (and therefore to the first printers) bulked up the text considerably; but still the usual folio Terence with the late ancient commentary of Aelius Donatus in smaller type surrounding the text (called <em>Terentius cum Donato</em>) was a fairly slender volume of about 120 leaves. Such books were edited in the manner of scholastic texts of the Middle Ages; they represented manuals for teachers and introduced advanced students to the forms of text usual in university-level study.</p>\n<p>Because the plays were so often recommended for school use, however, they also attracted new humanist commentaries, which appealed to printers as added value in a competitive market. Indeed, we may well call the first thirty years of Terence in print the age of commentary. So we find such titles as <em>Terentius cum duobus commentis</em> or <em>Terentius cum quattuor commentis</em>. By the end of the century Venetian printers could offer <em>Terentius cum quinque commentis</em>, a standard collection with the commentaries of Donatus and Servius from the ancient world, and those of humanists Giovanni Calfurnio (d. 1503), Guy Jouenneaux (d. 1507), and Josse Bade Ascensius (1462 \"“ 1535). (32) This collection reflected the internationalism of the school use of Terence, for only one of the humanist commentators was Italian. The others were Northerners first published in France and imported by Venetian printers in the fourteen nineties to enhance the competitiveness of their books. Needless to say, five commentaries printed in parallel alongside the base text vastly enlarged the book. The late-century folios of this type often run to 250 or even 300 leaves with printed matter crowding out to the limits of the margin. Editions of the text without commentary virtually disappeared, though some printers at the end of the century continued to offer the slimmer format of Terence with a single commentary, usually that of Donatus.</p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/Wing-f.-ZP-535.S417,-Terentius-cum-tribus..title-page.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/Wing-f.-ZP-535.S417,-Terentius-cum-tribus..title-page.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Terence with three commentaries (click to enlarge - 458 KB jpeg file)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/Wing-f.-ZP-535.S673,Terentius-cum-quinque-commentis-videlicet-Donati,-Guidonis,-Calphurnii,-t.p.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/Wing-f.-ZP-535.S673,Terentius-cum-quinque-commentis-videlicet-Donati,-Guidonis,-Calphurnii,-t.p.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Terence with five commentaries (click to enlarge - 452 KB jpeg file)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Commentaries were increasingly part of the marketing strategy of printers.

This glorification of editors and commentators eventually found expression in the handsome title pages and frontispieces that appear in editions late in the fifteenth century. They show Terence lecturing from his professorial cathedra surrounded by admiring disciples making notes at desks, each labeled with the name of one of the commentary authors.

(35) In order to reflect all this additional apparatus, page layouts became more intricate and title pages got increasingly detailed in their marketing claims. Glareanus, writing in 1540, expressed no small exasperation at the state of Terence in print:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Concerning [Terence] today, there are so many commentaries recently printed, so many annotations, such a patched-together mosaic-work that it could appear singularly shameless to compose more. And yet...very little [of what is in print] will prove to be of any moment, while much of it instead is inept and falsely published. (36)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Glareanus had the exaggerated claims of publishers in mind as well as the work of the annotators and editors.</p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/Wing-f.-ZP-535.S417,-Terentius-cum-tribus..pg.6v-7r.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/Wing-f.-ZP-535.S417,-Terentius-cum-tribus..pg.6v-7r.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Text with commentary (click to enlarge - 673 KB jpeg file)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Through most of the incunable period, Italian printers favored setting Terence in the usual medieval and early humanist form of text-with-commentary.

Since the text of Terence also breaks into acts and scenes, this layout not rarely produced double-page spreads that have three or even four distinct windows floating like islands in the commentary.

Typically the textbooks treated at length merit inclusion either because they are telling in pedagogical terms (they were widely used, or somehow innovative, or else highly traditional), or because their publishing history exemplifies some particular problem of production or marketing. The comedies of Terence, the Donat, and the proverbs of Pseudo-Cato (treated in chapters one and two), for example, were traditional school texts with particularly long publication histories. Inherited from the pagan past, they had been moralized across centuries of classroom use in the Christian Middle Ages. These texts show how medieval manuscript models were transformed, sometimes slowly and at other times in rapid spurts, before the invention of print, by print technology, and again by changes in pedagogical fashion.</p>\n<p>By contrast, most Latin grammars, whether innovative or conservative, were modern print products that had short and local histories. Twenty years was a long life for such a text, fifty or more a rare feat. (Chapters three and four offer examples.) Only a few grammars remained in use for centuries (examples are discussed in chapters four and five). Alternatives to the most popular texts were offered at several periods during the course of the long sixteenth century. I have tried to include works, then, with both long and short, wide-spread and local use.</p>\n<p>Most of what I have included concerns the Latin schools and the Latin curriculum. Latin was the international language of humanism, and Latin schools offered the most prestigious, sophisticated, and internationalizing kind of education. They promoted the creation of schoolbooks to match in both prestige and ambition. Latin books, even elementary ones, had an international market, so the study of those printed in Italy (especially Venice) has particular importance for the wider history of educational publishing. Textbooks imported into Italy offer still other insights on marketing.</p>\n<p>However, humanism created a philological world in which serious study of the vernaculars could also be undertaken, and so in the final two chapters I have also tried to survey other kinds of textbooks on the Italian market and beyond Italy. Those for commercial education, mathematics, and music represent the future of European textbook publishing. (They are treated in chapter six.) As a coda (chapter seven), I address the history of a new form, the emblem book, which was invented by humanists in the sixteenth century and sometimes used in schools. All these books may be seen as popularizations of Latin high culture, and early on they typically had this function whatever else their authors may have been attempting. As the sixteenth century progressed, however, these vernacular forms also developed a logic -- or more exactly, a series of logics -- of their own. Considering them mere popularizations would distort the meanings they had even in the earliest years of printing in Italy. (26) Specifically, the authors and publishers of vernacular textbooks seem to have felt a particular need to moralize loftily in traditional Christian terms. This tendency derived in part from worries about popularizing. Popularizers knew that they were offering tools once restricted to elites to a broader audience and they worked hard to teach the proper, moral applications of technique. (27)</p>\n<p>Traditional Latin pedagogy communicated many lessons to the new vernacular teaching, most importantly the notion that all learning should be an education to virtue. This stance was reflected directly in schoolbooks on both sides of the linguistic divide. Modern scholars differ in their evaluations of the effectiveness of the humanist program as an education to moral decision making, but they tend to agree that Latin educators consistently claimed to be teaching morals as well as literary or scientific subjects. (28) Vernacular teachers did the same. The publisher of one arithmetic put it thus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This book is offered to those thoughtful and modest youths, whom it will please to study it with diligence (all agitation put aside). Finding it corrected in many places and with several pertinent additions, and taking pleasure in its convenient usefulness, they will take care to give thanks to Jesus Christ, who has granted that they be able to work for the common benefit of good folk. (29)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This kind of introduction was not at all unusual. The sentiments are repeated over and over with increasing urgency as the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter Reform progressed. (30)</p>\n<p>Whether the subject was language, handwriting, mathematics, geography or music, humanist teachers took their cue from Plato, more or less Christianized as needed. Teachers merely tailored the notion of educating the good citizen in moral behaviors to the subject at hand and to the level of discourse they chose for it. This was the strategy of music teacher Franchino Gaffurio, writing in the 1490s:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Socrates and Plato and also the Pythagoreans, attributing a moral resource to music, ordered by a common law that adolescents and youth, and young women too, be educated in music, not for inciting to desire, through which this discipline becomes cheapened, but for moderating the movements of the soul through rule and reason. . . . Now, since the nature of boys is restless and desirous of amusements all the time and on that account does not tolerate severe discipline, Plato himself orders that boys be educated to honest music, the pleasure of which most commonly offers the pathways of virtue. On the other hand it is occasionally also to be assigned to older men as an honest amusement for the consolation of a laborious life. (31)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gaffurio here echoed several sentiments that derived from his classical sources and that were commonplaces of humanist pedagogy. Learning is life-long; it is best achieved when discipline can be combined with pleasure; it conduces to the common good.</p>\n<p>In the ancient world, and in most Latin-school contexts of the fifteenth and early sixteenth century, these generalizations were intended for the political classes. Only boys of respectable birth would need to master the commonplaces. Starting in the early years of the sixteenth century, publishers of vernacular textbooks faced a new need, to expand such classicizing ideals to apply in the market for mass-produced and relatively cheap books aimed at a new public. They were helped along by expertise they had gained in the marketplace for Latin textbooks in the first fifty years of printing and by an advertising rhetoric they had also developed in that period.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(26) Hellinga 1988, 39-140; Rummel 1995, 107-125; Waswo 1999, 410-412; Waquet 2001, 7-26, 207-229.</li>\n<li>(27) Bell 1999, 14-18; Houston 2002, 220-222.</li>\n<li>(28) Grafton and Jardine 1986, xii-xiv, 22-28; Grendler 1989, 102-108, 114-121; Gehl 1993, 116-127; Black 2001, 24-33 and 2007, 298-300; Frazier 2005, 14-16.</li>\n<li>(29) Tagliente 1548; see chapter 6.</li>\n<li>(30) Toscani 1993, 107-112; on the correction of texts as moral act, Lerer 2002, 15-53; West 2006, 253-261; on the Counter-Reformation convergence of philological and religious conservatism, Wyatt 2005, 204-209, 218-223.</li>\n<li>(31) Trans. by Palisca 1985, 193.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"My overall approach has been to choose a very few texts and authors to explore in some depth and a few others to set the broader context.

When it was absolutely necessary to have three or four letters to differentiate characters, the line beginning is indented so that the name will not extend further into the margin. This basic page layout was retained by the Aldine press into the fifteen eighties. The 1517 first Aldine edition presented a text which had been worked up by Aldo himself and was finalized for the press in the year after Aldo's death by Gian Francesco Torresani Asolano (1498-1557?). (45) Many competitors of the Aldine press adopted this text wholesale and later editors adopted it as a starting point. It remained the basic text for Aldine editions until that of 1553, when Paolo Manuzio corrected it for a new edition. This must have seemed too little change in a market crowded with more recent scholarly editions, for Manuzio turned to Marc Antoine Muret (1526-1585) to edit an entirely new Terence only two years later. But the formatting remained largely the same through these changes of editor and through many subsequent, corrected editions of Muret's text.

The Giunta press at Florence began to print Terence in octavo in 1505 and presented the text in an Aldine style. (47) This was a patent attempt to beat the Aldine press to the school market with a small-format Terence. The page size was a more normal octavo shape than Aldo's, but the typography is Aldine in the extreme. Especially notable is the Giunta title page, on which Filippo Giunta ignored all other typographical standards and gave the author's name in a severe all-caps triangle that reflects the earliest Aldines. [TERENTIVS IN SVA ME / TRA RETITTV / TVS / [two dots] / [one dot]] The colophon is equally austere and the book attests the degree of admiration the earliest Aldine octavos evoked. The Giunta press abandoned the Aldine model entirely after 1565, at the same time they turned to a new editor for a small-format Terence with apparatus. Aldo's in-laws, the Torresani family, on the other hand, retained the original, severe formatting for editions of Terence until 1570.</p>\n<p>One of Aldo's greatest admirers was the same Alessandro Paganino who experimented with a quarto Terence in 1526. Paganino issued a series of books in an entirely new format, the 24mo, between 1515 and 1525. The series was both modeled on and intended to rival the Aldine octavos. One such 24mo was a Terence that appeared in 1516 (but is mistakenly dated 1506 in its colophon). It is worth comparing it to the first Aldine Terence, which appeared in the next year. Paganino's title page was \"Aldine\" in its severity, reading simply TERENTIVS IN SVA / METRA RESTI- / TVTVS (following the Giunta title pages of 1505 and 1509). Such purely typographic titles, in fact, imitated the earliest Aldine octavos, those from 1501 to 1505 that appeared without printer's mark, and not the more developed form that was normal by 1516. (T</p>\n<p>Paganino had taken up some Aldine ideas but did not merely copy them. At its origin, the Aldine octavo was an imitation of graceful, small, late humanist manuscripts. As Angela Nuovo remarks, it was a bit of a step backward in book-history terms because it looked to manuscript models rather than building on the traditions already pioneered by and for print. Certainly its models were retrospective. But as Nuovo has also shown, this was not the case for the Paganino 24mos, which represented both design and production models that were purely typographic and without precedent in manuscript culture. They required immense mechanical precision, depended on highly skilled type founders and typesetters, and employed an imposition scheme that required handling the type forms and sheets more carefully than ever in the past.

Terence, as we have already remarked, suffered relative neglect in textual terms in the early years of printing. From the late fourteen nineties onward, however, the plays were the subject of intense textual criticism among leading humanists. The record of their work is precisely evidenced in successive editions; but no general history of Terence criticism in this period has ever been written. A full account will have to await the work of future scholars. (53) It is clear, however, that the Italian market for Terence had languished after 1490. It revived in the new century, when new formats were offered just at the moment when a much improved text was also becoming available. Italians would see many attempts to improve the quality of the text in the next half-century, but teachers were little content with any single version until Paolo Manuzio commissioned a new text from French humanist Marc Antoine Muret (1526-1585) that became available in 1555. Thereafter the market was dominated by this text, whether Muret's contribution was attributed or not.</p>\n<p>The Sessa firm of Venice attempted to rival Muret in 1566 with a text based on a 1548 Basel edition by Theodor Poelmann; but Poelmann's text never achieved anything like the currency in Italy that Muret's would have for fifty-odd years. Similarly, in 1565 the Florentine Giunta published a text based on the work of Gabriele Faerno (1510-1561). The Medici family had long patronized Faerno, most recently in the person of Pope Pius IV, and the book was dedicated to no less a personage than Carlo Borromeo, cardinal archbishop of Milan. The publishers made great claims for its critical superiority because Faerno, employed for twenty years at the Vatican library, had had access to many early manuscripts. Scholars all over Europe admired and studied the work of Faerno, but the Giunta were the only ones to offer this text of Terence. (54)</p>\n<p>Giovanni Griffio, as we have seen, promoted the text edited and annotated by Antonio de Gouveia starting in 1555; the Griffio press stuck to this text through more than a dozen editions, so it must have found a school market as a learned alternative to Muret's text. Seventeenth-century editions by Northern European editors would find a still larger Italian market, but this success came in the period of the decline of the Venetian press. It is impossible in the present state of the evidence to say how much of their success should be credited to the quality of their philological work and what was due simply to the lack of effective competition from Italian publishers after 1600.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/HFS_130.03.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/HFS_130.03.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\"></figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>From the start, however, the marketing claims of printers and publishers reflected the philological advances of editors. We have already mentioned the work of Poliziano, the first really critical examination Terence received, stimulated by his collation of the text of the Codex Bembinus.

The exact history of the family is unclear, but the elder Giovanni Griffio printed from 1544 to 1576 in Venice, and in Padua as well from 1555 to 1563. He was succeeded by unnamed heirs who printed in 1576-77 only, and then by another Giovanni Griffio, probably his son or nephew, who was active from 1577 to end of century. The elder Giovanni established a basic format for Terence in 1555 and reprinted at least nine times before 1575. His heirs reprinted again in 1576. The younger Giovanni reprinted at least four more times.</p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/Wing-ZP-535.G8695,-Comoediae-sex,-accurate-sane,-pg.87v-88r.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/Wing-ZP-535.G8695,-Comoediae-sex,-accurate-sane,-pg.87v-88r.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Griffio layout (clilck to enlarge - 491 KB jpeg file)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>The Griffio octavos did not take their inspiration from the formatting of contemporary Aldines, nor did they reprise the text or austere typography of earlier Aldines. Instead, their design was self-consciously busy and cluttered, as if a homely page were just the right look for a schoolroom text. In this regard, they almost seem to be imitating the crowded 12mos and 24mos offered earlier in the century, taking their start from a look that was originally enforced by the tiny page and importing it back into the slightly more spacious octavo. Their text was that of Portuguese humanist Antonio de Gouveia, whose extensive commentary was first printed in Italy by Girolamo Scoto in 1545. In the Griffio octavos, selections from the Gouveia apparatus were offered. Each scene was provided with a prose argument, delimited by a title in all caps and variously set in tiny italic or roman type, depending on the edition. Numerous marginalia crowded into a clearly defined note column at the outside margin of each page. The verse forms were de-emphasized by the layout because the names of the characters, abbreviated to one or two capital letters, are set into the lines to regularize the left margin, and because the page is so crowded that it almost looks like prose.</p>\n<p>The Griffio printing house set the type for each successive edition anew, usually reprinting on a line-by-line and page-by page basis. This was the elder Giovanni's general practice from 1555 to 1571 and his heirs resumed the practice in later editions. Such close reprinting would have saved on typesetting costs and recommended the new editions to teachers familiar with older ones. The practice was largely maintained even through a major change in the basic design of the book in 1575. Despite the economies realized in reprinting, however, the text was not entirely stable even within the Griffio house. The elder Giovanni usually named the editor on the tile page, with a phrase like \"œornamented with the annotations of Antonio de Gouveia.\" (50) It may be that the printer was proud to have introduced the editorial work of this prominent Portuguese humanist to the small-format Italian market. He certainly thought of the claim as a marketing tool. After the older Griffio's death, however, his heirs dropped this advertisement in favor of a simpler description for the same material, \"œwith marginal annotations.\" (51) The explicit mention of Gouveia actually disappeared on the title page of 1575, the last edition during Giovanni the Elder's lifetime; but since this edition appeared in the year of his death, it may be that the design, which is very different in other ways from earlier editions, was out of his hands. It is surely significant that the usage of seven editions should disappear just in the year of his death, and that the typography of the book should change so distinctly at the same time.</p>\n<p>Already in 1567 the elder Griffio had begun to experiment with the placement of the critical apparatus on the page. While for the most part still reprinting page by page, he moved some of the front matter around and deleted Gouveia's notes on meter from the marginalia (opening up the page a bit). In 1575 these metrical indications reappeared in small type with the arguments at the start of each scene (just as the author Gouveia's name disappeared from the title). From 1575 onward, moreover, the book was illustrated, but the woodcuts were purely ornamental. There was a conventional portrait of the author at his desk at the start of the introduction (the standard <em>Life of Terence</em> by Aelius Donatus) and thereafter each of the six plays begins with the same conventional cut of a single actor representing the Prologus on a large Renaissance stage with a crowd of onlookers in the pit. (52) The most important departure of the 1575 and 1576 editions, however, was a decision to frame each page with typographic rules that also separate the field of the text from the column of notes. These ruled borders did not really clarify the organization of the information in any way and they cluttered the overall page even more than the earlier format had done. The rules were abandoned for the editions of the fifteen eighties and nineties, perhaps in the hope of achieving a more spacious look. From 1575 onward, however, the firm maintained its line-by-line reprinting and made no further editorial changes.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>50 Terence 1567b, 1569b; compare Terence 1555b, 1557, etc.\r\n51 Terence 1575, 1576.\r\n52 The block is similar to one of the Prologus that appears in the influential Scoto and Bonelli editions (Terence 1545 and 1561).

The form could be elaborate or summary. A number of editions of the fifteen fifties, for example, carried routine boastfulness to a perfunctory extreme with titles that read, The <em>Six Comedies of Publius Terentius Afer</em>, <em>lately corrected with the greatest diligence according to all the editions of all [six plays]</em>. (61) The phrase was safely impossible to verify. At the other extreme were claims made for the text of Marc Antoine Muret. Muret and his publisher Paolo Manuzio portrayed themselves as vigilant correctors of the text. They let themselves in for criticism on this account because humanist scholars immediately replied with further corrections. The 1555 Muret text of Terence was particularly problematic in this way because it abandoned the older Aldine text, edited originally by Aldo the Elder and still much admired at mid-century. The Muret Terence even became a cause for debate at the papal court since both Muret and his principal critic, Gabriele Faerno, were clients of Pius IV.

Not only was the text corrected in almost innumerable places by Muret, something everyone knew had happened across many editions, but it was also furnished with Muret's notes giving the reasons for most of the corrections he made, and the book was carefully restored to the quality of Muret's original by the use of more than one corrected exemplar. Aldo Manuzio the Younger (1547-1597) adopted a similar advertisement on a 1588 title page, perhaps in an attempt to blunt criticism that the Aldine press had offered Muret's text in sloppy editions in the previous decade.

This front matter was remarkably stable once it had been set by Scoto. In 1553, Bartolomeo Cesano rearranged it very slightly and, by employing a much smaller type face, managed to add a four-page index within the fourteen leaves of front matter. Giovanni Maria Bonelli took over Cesano's formatting in page-for-page and line-for-line reprints of this same front matter in 1561 and 1567; and Bonelli's heirs reprinted it again in 1570.</p>\n<p>Title pages from 1545 to the end of the century also stick closely to pattern typographically, although, since these are advertisements, the wording varies somewhat. In 1553, for example, Cesano trumpeted all the things he borrowed from earlier editions right on the title page: commentaries by four big names (Donatus, Cenomanni, Marsi, and Calfurnio); prefatory material by Desiderius Erasmus, summaries and notes in text by Phillip Melancthon, Antonio Gouveia, Bartholomaeus Latomus, Heinrich Glareanus, and Joannes Rivius; and marginal variants to the traditional text following the prestigious editions of Aldus and Gryphius. This puffery was a variant of Scoto's 1545 table of contents; but where Scoto had placed the adverts on the verso of the title page, presumably to preserve the classical restraint of his title, Cesano opted for more up-front advertising and a more crowded title page.</p>\n<p>After they appeared on the <em>Index of Prohibited Books</em> in the fifteen fifties, the names of Erasmus and Melanchthon were often cancelled by hand, both on the title pages and also inside the books. (64) But the useful classroom materials they had composed were left intact. A close reprint of the title and front matter of Cesano's edition was that of Bonelli in 1561. This contained all the advertising prose of Cesano with three significant changes. The contributions of Erasmus and Melancthon, though found in their assigned places inside the book, do not appear in the list on the title page and are unattributed in the text -- a direct typographic imitation of the manual censorship we can witness in surviving copies of the earlier editions. A third change is less easily explained. Cesano had taken over Scoto's 1545 wording to advertise the presence of important marginal variants from Aldine and Gryphius editions. Bonelli uses the same wording but fails to name the sources. Apparently the association of these materials with the great Venetian and Lyonese presses of the past seemed like good advertising to Cesano but not to Bonelli.</p>\n<p>The Scoto-Cesano-Bonelli model influenced other Venetian printers as well, though others felt able to depart from the pattern to some degree. Perhaps in reaction to the slavish copies of his earlier Terence made by Cesano and Bonelli, Girolamo Scoto issued a new Terence in 1569 that compressed the front matter into ten leaves. He was really reprinting his own 1545 edition, however, and not that of his rivals on the market, and so he did not include their indexes. He discreetly omitted all explicit mention of Erasmus and Melancthon, although he included their invaluable introductory material and comments. To emphasize the supposed novelty of his edition, moreover, he redesigned the title page, abandoning the chaste classicism of his 1545 title.

Venturino Ruffinelli, who preferred his own layout and design (using comic-strip style illustrations), copied the 1545 text slavishly in 1546, but squeezed it into a page layout that had been designed for his 1539 edition of Gouveia's text. The basic layout problem in the case of Terence was that the text consists of short scenes with much back-and-forth badinage while the apparatus was typically very lengthy. As we have already noted, early printers of text with commentary had arranged the commentary for each scene in humanist-manuscript form all around the base text, creating a window or windows for the words of Terence. The resulting window-and-frame layouts are visually very lively, with each spread slightly different from the last, depending on the length of the commentary with respect to the text. (65) As the sixteenth century progressed, however, it became more usual to employ a simple two-column format that placed the base text of each scene first and the commentary afterwards, alternating but running continuously from column to column. The four columns on a spread owned variety and visual interest because the text of Terence was set in larger type and more generously leaded than the commentary, but the result was rarely as handsome as the older manuscript-style layouts. This two-column format took over because it was much easier to set, correct, revise, and reprint than a window-and-frame.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/HFS_112.04.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/HFS_112.04.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Scotto at his best, 1545 (click to enlarge - 726 KB JPEG image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Similarly, fewer and fewer options were exercised in ornamenting and illustrating the folio text as the century wore on.

These books preserve something of the grace of earlier folios, with both the repeated author portraits and the scene-by-scene illustrations that had characterized some folio editions in the fourteen nineties and early in the sixteenth century. Illustrations of individual scenes disappeared entirely after the 1555, perhaps because the enthusiasm for their rediscovery had waned, and again in recognition of the fact that they added little beyond their ornamental value.

The inevitable result was that schoolbooks tended to lag a few years behind the latest ornamental fashions. <em>Iniziali parlanti</em> (\"speaking intitials\" that included classical or biblical scenes) were fashionable in Venice from 1530 onward.

They were explained further in a preface addressed to the Medici prince. It is no wonder, Fabrini wrote, that there are few learned men, since traditional schooling in languages seems designed to repel the student from the start. Fabrini designed his book instead to encourage Cosimo's two sons to find language study easier and therefore to get excited about other sorts of learning. The commentary in Tuscan ensures that they will be able to understand the explanations of the Latin base text without having to decipher more Latin and it avoids the further bad practice of making them read barbarous modern Latin. It obviates even the ancient commentaries. The young princes were to concentrate instead on the pure diction of Terence.</p>\n<p>Fabrini's work was imitated in Spain by Pedro SimÃ³n Abril (1530?-1595) who proposed a bilingual Latin/Spanish Terence as a way of learning Latin through translation. A first edition appeared in 1577, and it was revised in 1583 with an improved Latin text based on that of Gabriele Faerno. Abril acknowledged his debt to Fabrini in a dedicatory letter to young Prince Ferdinand of Austria, son of Emperor Ferdinand II, for whom he claimed the same solicitous care as Fabrini had displayed toward the Medici princelings. Abril made far fewer claims than Fabrini, however. He was mostly interested in helping Spaniards learn Latin; if they could also improve their vernacular style, that would be of benefit, but it was not the goal of reading Terence. On the other hand Abril offered an entire reading list of texts he says are best studied in bilingual editions: Terence, to be sure, but also, Aesop, Cicero, and the catechism of Pius V. Abril's intent was to make these classic texts, which every educated person should know well, easier to learn.

In Fabrini's book, but not in Abril's imitation of it, Terence was a vehicle for language study generally, not merely of Latin but of the vernacular as well. Of course, literary Tuscan was an acquired skill for most Italian writers of the period, and the best terms of linguistic analysis available were still in fact those of Latin grammar. Thus, in the second part of his book, what Fabrini entitled \"the interpretation of vernacular and Latin language,\" he expressly claimed that his is not an elementary grammar but one for those who already know the first principles of Latin. Apparently, however, he imagined that once the student arrives at the intermediate-Latin stage of reading Terence, he should proceed to study Latin and Tuscan by mutual translation. In his dedicatory letter to Cosimo de' Medici he mounted a spirited defense of translation as a cultural and educational activity. His claim in providing a translation manual along with his text of Terence was that the rules for nouns and verbs are common to both languages and that the mastery of each expressive need in either tongue is achieved by understanding the equivalent expressions in the other. So a typical subject heading is \"Concerning vernacular infinitives, and which of them have to be translated as Latin infinitives and which as Latin gerunds.\" (79) \"All these things,\" he continued, \"are demonstrated with general rules and confirmed with the authority of Latin writers, especially with the authority of Cicero and Terence.\" (80)</p>\n<p>While Fabrini's grammar was a sort of translation manual, he compiled the appendix of usages which follows as a compositional aid. It was an index to ideas and themes in Terence, based directly on his commentary. The indexing terms were listed in Tuscan with page citations to the Latin text, with the intention of aiding the reader in composing Latin prose or finding passages to quote. The appendix had its own dedicatory letters (three of them!) in which Fabrini explained that he composed this index for the use of a certain diplomat who felt the need of an aid to finding Latin phrases appropriate for conversation and oratory in foreign lands. Fabrini had already prepared a similar compositional manual based on Cicero's prose, but the Terence seemed an easier and more urgent work to publish since the diplomat had virtually all of Cicero by heart. Terence was both shorter and more directly useful, then, for someone who wants to mine the classics for elegant phrases appropriate to speechmaking. So much for Fabrini's expressed intentions. Given that the index is dependent on his own annotated text of Terence and that it is listed on the title pages of those editions where it appears, we may also suspect that it was also added for the sake of marketing them. Certainly, Fabrini's Terence was one of the most successful of the century.

The first book published, Grasso's anti-Terence, was either a joke, or a deliberate attempt to bait the illustrious Giraldi family into a debate they thought was already settled, or both. Grasso got his diatribe printed by the Torrentino printing house in MondovÃ­, the seat of the new Piedmontese university where Giambattista Giraldi Cinzio had recently been named professor. Giraldi Cinzio, who had just begun publishing with the Torrentino press, had been a protagonist for decades in a academic debates over dramatic poetry; he had repeatedly cited Terence in his attempts to define the meaning and scope of comedy. (85) It fell to his son Lucio Olimpio Giraldi to reply to Grasso's affront. The younger Giraldi is not known to have published anything but a few poems either before or after his defense of Terence, and it may simply be that he was looking for a quarrel that would allow him to cut his literary teeth in defense of a venerable humanist commonplace. It is even possible that the Giraldis set Grasso up for the fight, especially since the elder Giraldi was one of the most vigorous critics of the Jesuit educational paradigm and it was to their advantage to have the piety of the Counter-Reform seem to be an unsophisticated starting point for considering educational matters. (86)</p>\n<p>Grasso's booklet, however, though less polished than the younger Giraldi's, seems more genuinely serious or at least more earnest. He began with the notion that in modern times it is not obligatory to pay overmuch respect to secular writers. Unlike authorities in matters of religion, to whom humble deference is always due, the authors of pagan antiquity were justly censured when they were slight, inelegant, or obscene. Terence suffered all these defects, we are told; but Grasso reserved his most vehement criticism for the immoral behavior and immodest language of the comic characters. The low-life plots might make suitable reading for adults, who would take them as mere entertainment; but they should at all costs be kept away from boys who might instead imagine that they were admirable and worth imitating. (87)</p>\n<p>Giraldi's defense of Terence was more in the tradition of aesthetic appreciation, though not without political savvy. He was smugly convinced that Terence's place in the curriculum was not in any danger. Giraldi started by remarking that he must come to the comedian's defense personally because Terence was the school master from whom he himself had learned how \"to speak in good Latin on any subject, elegantly, and with dignity.\" (88) Giraldi lined up the ancient authorities on the quality of Terence's style and language. He then added citations from modern discussions of poetry, including those of Jacopo Sadoleto (1477-1547) and Pietro Bembo, both Roman cardinals as well as humanists. Giraldi argued all this vehemently but added nothing new to the debate; the weight of tradition was on his side.</p>\n<p>Giraldi turned to Grasso's moral argument only on page fifty-four of his eighty page book. The tone is scornful. Throughout, he had called his opponent not by name but \"Slanderer\" (<em>il Calonniatore</em>). Now he added that Grasso was just a pious hypocrite who wanted to forbid Terence to all the world, supposedly so the comedies will not corrupt the souls of the young. With a string of colorful epithets he made the point that Grasso was a sanctimonious do-gooder. (89) As withering as his tone was, however, Giraldi did not truly mount an effective counter-argument. He granted that bad images can incite the young to unwholesome desires, just as examples of great men can inspire them to do good. But then he turned the argument aside by insisting that the objectionable scenes in Terence are handled with admirable restraint and that the language is never really very coarse. This old humanist argument exactly opposed contemporary opinions expressed by the Jesuits. For Ignatius and his followers, Terence's plots had the potential to incite evil thoughts in adults as well as young people, and his language was irredeemably obscene. The learned fathers were troubled by exactly this power of drama to cause \"strange desires\" (Giraldi's paraphrase of Grasso's supposedly petty-pious fear).

Medieval and humanist ethics allowed considerable room for bawdy fun; the new morality was less tolerant. Still, there was room for debate, and the question did continue to be discussed. A decade after the Grasso/Giraldi debate, Pedro SimÃ³n Abril offered an equally pious, Counter-Reform <em>affirmation</em> of Terence by reprising the argument that the young learn from good and bad examples alike. He was careful to add that the contrary opinion is held by good and pious folk who worry that Terence offers too many dubious characters and too many examples of bad behavior. But Abril concluded that this reasoning is faulty because narratives of evil, whether in Terence or in the Bible, teach young men to abhor vice and avoid it. (91)</p>\n<p>With Abril, we leave the question of the suitability of Terence unresolved in theory but clear in the minds of teachers on each side of the debate. Banned from the Jesuit schools but almost universally used everywhere else, Terence was many things at once. He remained an ancient comedian, revered and studied for his language, for the dramatic interest of the plays, and as a model for modern dramatists. He had become scholastic auctor on ethics during the Middle Ages, and he continued to play this role for traditionalizing teachers who proposed him as a model for learning morality. But Terence was also, in the age of printing, a textbook author in need of careful editing, annotation, commentary, sometimes even censorship.

(82) The issue was not new but the moment is significant, for these were the first years after the closing sessions of the Council of Trent. Churchmen and laymen across Catholic Europe were grappling with moral strictures the council fathers proposed for everyday Christian life. A decade earlier, as the council was in session, Ignatius Loyola had ordered an expurgation of Terence to be produced for the use of the fast-growing Jesuit colleges. The effort continued for many years, largely unsuccessfully; and meanwhile the Jesuits eliminated Terence, forbidding its use by students and teachers alike on the grounds that the plays could not be made over into chaste and salutary texts. The Jesuits were followed in this ban by some other religious orders like the Barnabites. Thus, the largest school system in Europe renounced the most popular school author of the century. As we will see later and in greater detail in chapter five, Jesuit curriculum reforms like the suppression of Terence were largely accomplished by unilateral action of the superiors of the order. No public debate was invited, and none occurred. (83)</p>\n<p>By contrast, the protagonists of 1566 invited open debate about the use of Terence, though they themselves were obscure figures otherwise little known. Immediately, then, we may suspect them of careerism. We know nothing at all of Benedetto Grasso of Nice, self described anti-Terentian, except what he tells us in his book. Lucio Olimpio Giraldi, son of the eminent dramatist Giambattista Giraldi Cinzio (1504-1573) and grandson of the classicist Lilio Gregorio Giraldi (1479-1553) took the other part, in defense of Terence. The young Giraldi was in his early twenties, not yet an established figure. The controversy itself was short-lived, generating two small books from a single press. For the most part, the arguments expressed were not new; they represent themes that were implicit in the humanist endeavor from the start. The controversy merits our attention only because, like the Jesuits' renunciation, it provides a counterpoint to the continued success of Terence as a textbook. Grasso and Giraldi chose to join battle largely on literary grounds, but they ultimately had to come to terms as well with the increasingly prudish and morally sanctimonious tenor of the times. The age of open humanist debate was over.</p>\n<p>In the long humanist tradition of defending classical authors against Christian moralists for whom they represented dangerous invitations to paganism, the question of Terence would seem to have been settled by the end of the fifteenth century. As we remarked in section 1.02, both the forceful opinions of ancient and modern critics and the real practice of the schools endorsed the notion that Terence was good for school boys. The Academia Veneta summarized this standard opinion of Terence as one item in a long list of new editions they considered desiderata. Their prospective catalogue of 1559 included this entry:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Terence, with brief, learned annotations that explain the purity of the language he used, and further, how the virtues of human life and its vices were scattered about in his comedies and yet observed in the common persons described in them, since those things that can provoke so much laughter are also discerned in other comic authors. (84)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The academicians displayed a tranquil complacency about the position of Terence in the Latin curriculum.</p>\n<p>The controversialists of the fifteen sixties assigned a different meaning to the old commonplaces; their exchange derived a distinct color from its Counter-Reformation context. It is an early example of fully developed Tridentine piety in conflict with classicizing pedagogy.

Even provincial booksellers of the mid-seventeenth century could boast a variety of editions, and the buyer could choose among editors of great fame and distinction. Indeed, the market looks very modern. A teacher or student in Strasbourg in 1668 could take his pick from eight different seventeenth-century editions in several formats by five modern scholarly editors. A prosperous buyer might have opted for an omnibus edition, two volumes printed in 1619 at Neustadt an der Haardt that combined a critical text by Johann Philipp Pareus (1576-1648) with commentaries and emendations by six other scholars.

From the thirteenth century onward, they expected to start with two basic texts ascribed to ancient authors that together offered instruction for beginners in grammatical concepts and moral behavior. These texts were the Donat and the Cato, sometimes encountered individually but in Italy often confected as a single small textbook. The Donat was a late twelfth- or thirteenth-century question-and-answer introduction to Latin inflections named for a loosely similar grammar book of Aelius Donatus (mid-4th century C.E.) that was widely used in the early and high Middle Ages. Under the title <em>Distichs of Cato</em>, on the other hand, students read and memorized a collection of moral sayings that began with time-honored phrases, \"Pray to God; love thy parents; honor thy kin.\" Some early manuscripts of this collection bear the name Dionysius Cato, otherwise unknown, who was identified in the high Middle Ages with Marcus Portius Cato (d. 149 B.C.E.). (3) Both the Donatus and Cato attributions were incorrect but were part of the authority these texts owned in the Middle Ages. In what follows I will refer to these widely-used texts as \"the Donat\" and \"the Cato\" (the usage is an early modern English one) and to their authors as Pseudo-Donatus and Pseudo-Cato. These admittedly awkward forms have the advantage of mimicking what these booklets were called by Italian teachers and students of the period. Some modern scholars also label the work of Pseudo-Donatus by its opening word, <em>Ianua</em>. (4) In this they follow stationers and booksellers of the Renaissance who sometimes listed <em>Ianua</em> among their titles in stock. When I must refer to Aelius Donatus' authentic works, I will use his full name and the title <em>Ars minor</em> for his basic grammar.</p>\n<p>Italians called not only the attributed author and his text but also the physical textbook they used the Donat -- <em>il Donato</em>, or with a diminutive, <em>il Donadello</em>. Often they meant by this nothing more specific than \"grammar booklet.\" By the fourteenth century what the documents refer to as the Donat is almost always the schoolbook itself rather than the author, the text, or the course of study. The book in fact usually included other texts following that of Pseudo-Donatus, most often the <em>Distichs of Cato</em>. By the late thirteenth century in some parts of Italy, stationers could supply cheap copies of the Donat and the Cato (or both together under the one name, Donat) on a few sturdy parchment leaves, which might be used successively by several students studying across many years. (5) Well before the Renaissance, then, and long before printing, Italian stationers had created the expectation that boys in the elementary Latin classroom would have access to their own copies of these first Latin booklets. These are among the first known books designed specifically for the use of children. They were tools for learning both grammar and morals. They seem also to have been intended as marketing tools, that is, for inculcating the expectation of owning one's own books. They served as models for the layout and design of other primary readers that would appeal to youngsters. Thus, educational marketing and marketing-as-education were born together on the eve of the Italian Renaissance.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(3) Thompson and Perraud 1990, 49-58.</li>\n<li>(4) Sabbadini 1896; Grendler 1989, 174-194, 413-16; Black 2001, 42-63, 366-378; Black 2007, 44-45.</li>\n<li>(5) Gehl 1993, 59-61; Black 2001, 85 n. 139; Banker 2003, 65-71.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Once they had mastered the alphabet and a few simple prayers, then, the most serious students, overwhelmingly boys, set out on the Latin course.

Of thirty-one recorded editions before 1500, only six were made outside Italy, including two in England and one in Barcelona, both places with significant Italian communities and active Italian teachers. Almost all of these small printed books (they usually consist of thirty-six or forty pages including both the Donat and the Cato) come down to us in single copies, so it is certain that there were many other editions that do not survive. The Donat in this form was printed in all major printing centers (Rome, Florence, Venice, and Milan), but also in smaller towns like L'Aquila and Pescia. It was a staple of printers, a booklet with an assured market that could easily be printed up in small numbers and could therefore be used to keep presses and pressmen busy when larger projects languished. Totally unlike the printed <em>Ars minor</em> of Aelius Donatus in Northern Europe, which usually stood alone, the Italian Donat was usually found with the Cato in the same little booklet. (14) Italian printers were selling what modern educational publishers would call a package, neatly designed to fit the basic reading course common in Italy.</p>\n<p>We have evidence of three attempts to modernize the text of the Donat before the end of the fifteenth century. About 1487 the first edition of Antonio Mancinelli's <em>Better Donat</em> (<em>Donatus melior</em>) appeared, largely just a corrected basic text arranged in an attractive quarto pamphlet for student use. Mancinelli (1452-1506) was a renowned teacher; his works were widely adopted in humanist classrooms. Like many of Mancinelli's other textbooks, his new and improved Donat lasted as long as his personal reputation as a teacher did; it was printed repeatedly for about thirty years in Venice and Milan and reprinted in France. After the fifteen twenties it went out of use almost entirely in the booklet form Mancinelli had given it, though his corrected text was incorporated into most later editions. (15)</p>\n<p>In the fourteen nineties, Venetian printers and teachers made another attempt to dress the Donat in new clothes, in this case in bilingual editions with interlinear Italian text sometimes called a *Donat Understood *(<em>Donato al senno</em>). (16) Editions of this sort also give Italian equivalents for most or all of the <em>Distichs of Cato</em>. It had four printings at Venice before 1500, but it is difficult to trace this version of the text beyond that date because catalogers do not always distinguish it from the Latin-only editions. It was in print as late as 1670. At Milan in 1570 it was still a common classroom text, because printer Vincenzo Girardone had it on press at the time of his death that year. Apparently he was attempting to make some quick cash at a moment when he could not undertake more ambitious projects because he was gravely ill. He must have anticipated a ready market. (17) Still, it is not very clear what audience the authors and publishers had in mind for this book during its long life. The text could not have been intended for students learning to read in the vernacular, since the subject of the book is Latin grammar only. For Latin students the bilingual text must have been intended as an aid to comprehending the rules, so it was probably a response to the difficulty presented by the Donat as a diagnostic text. Students using the bilingual Donat were simply being given a crib for their promotion exams. (18)</p>\n<p>In 1500 a third reworking of the <em>Ianua</em> with Cato appeared, also at Venice, edited by (or at least under the name of) the renowned humanist Pomponio Leto. The title of the only surviving copy says it was \"ornamented in new order\" by Leto (<em>per Pomponium letum novo ordine decorata</em>). But Leto had died in 1498, and so it is unclear how many of the book's innovations in layout and design are to be attributed to him and which are the work of the printers, the De Gregori brothers, well known for the originality of their woodcut illustrations. Whoever they were, the author and designers of this Donat proceeded by presenting the grammatical doctrines as much as possible in diagram form, expressly so as to facilitate memorization. (19) The front cover of the book offers a tree-form diagram of the parts of grammar, the parts of speech, and the verb constructions (tied to the moods of the verb) -- an outline of sorts of the contents of the book as a whole. On later pages the printers arranged the paradigms in clear, chart-like columns (perhaps imitating the 1468 grammar of Niccolò Perotti); and they dressed the text in unusually complex typography, using no fewer than four different gothic types and several woodcuts. These woodcuts are for the most part simple brackets taken over from the scientific and legal books the De Gregori brothers had been publishing for some years. Here they serve to break down a given doctrinal statement into its two, three, or four parts.

His great reputation led to the confusing situation throughout Europe that almost any basic grammar could be called a Donat. Two authentic compilations have come down to us under his name, the so-called <em>Donatus major</em>, a substantial treatment of morphology, and the <em>Donatus minor</em> or <em>Ars minor</em>, a question-and-answer style introduction to the same material intended for drilling basic rules. This authentic minor Donatus was widely used in medieval Europe, where beginning Latin students were often called <em>donatistae</em>; but by the thirteenth century it was replaced in most Italian schools by Pseudo-Donatus, a different catechetical primer with a verse preface that begins <em>Ianua sum rudibus</em>..., \"I am a doorway for beginners...\" (6)</p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/2.00_Chapter_Two/HFS_057.02.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/2.00_Chapter_Two/HFS_057.02.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">HFS_057.02-thumb</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\r\nOddly, by most common-sense standards Pseudo-Donatus or *Ianua* offered students a more difficult starting point and the book was much harder going than the old *Ars minor* of Aelius Donatus. The catechetical or question-and-answer portions of the two works are easily distinguishable. The *Ars minor* in the common Northern European, late medieval form starts its doctrinal section, \"How many parts of speech are there? Eight, that is, the noun, the pronoun....\" (7) The *Ianua*, after the verse prologue, begins more abruptly, \"What part of speech is *poet*? It is a noun. How so a noun? Because it signifies a substance...\" (8) Both texts, jump into abstract grammatical terminology from the start. But the Italian Donat does so completely without explanation, while the work of Aelius Donatus, composed in the late ancient world for Latin speakers, at least tried to move in a logical fashion from general concepts to more specialized ones. In fact, the *Ianua* would be criticized throughout the humanist period for its unfriendliness to beginners; but it probably was invented with the opposite intention in mind, to make the first part of the course more concrete. While Aelius Donatus's *Ars minor* was a brief sketch of grammatical concepts for students who already spoke some form of Latin, the Italian Donat was originally a drilling book that went into considerable detail for students coming to the language for the first time. (9)\n<p>The manuscript tradition of <em>Ianua</em> in has been explored in depth by Robert Black and Gabriella Pomaro. (10) Surviving manuscripts are few, but in outline the history of the text is clear. By the fourteenth century <em>Ianua</em> dominated the Italian pedagogical landscape, virtually to the exclusion of the genuine work of Aelius Donatus and most other beginning grammars. (11) But as Black and Pomaro have demonstrated, it was not a stable text. In origin, it was a fulsome drilling text that rehearsed all standard forms and many irregular ones. It could be stuffed full of all kinds of examples and mnemonic verses, depending on the needs of the teacher and the level of study. In the thirteenth century it may have been intended as more of an intermediate than a beginner's grammar, but by the fifteenth century it had been substantially abbreviated and definitively took on the role it would have in the age of print, as the first introduction to Latin reading. Black explains this development as a byproduct of the increasing differentiation of the school curriculum. As grammar masters more and more concentrated on intermediate Latin instruction, they abandoned the Donat to teachers of reading, whose mission was to instruct the students in the alphabet, prayers, and deciphering and memorizing texts. More and more, then, the Donat became a skeleton grammar, a series of rules to be memorized without much immediate understanding or application. For students who went on with the Latin course it provided the basic terms and paradigms, but little more; for many others it was in fact the last Latin text they would ever see. In the course of the fifteenth century it seems increasingly to have been relegated to this minor role. (12)</p>\n<p>Whether as a last text in the basic reading course or as a useful summary grammar, it is clear that the Donat in Italy was also a diagnostic text. It stood at the point when parents and teachers decided that a few beginning students would go on to become Latinists, while the largest number of pupils were weeded out. These latter students abandoned the formal Latin course, and either did not study further or went on to study practical matters like business math. (13) It was in this diagnostic role that the Donat entered the age of printing. It would necessarily change again in the sixteenth century. As humanists increasingly insisted upon the role of Latin as an instrument of power and beauty, they would become increasingly ill content with a text like the Donat that presented Latin grammar as a barrier to be crossed.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(6) Follak 2007, 151-152.</li>\n<li>(7) <em>Partes orationis quot sunt? octo, que nomen, pronomen, ...</em></li>\n<li>(8) <em>Poeta que pars est? nomen est. quare est nomen? quia significat substantiam...</em></li>\n<li>(9) Black 2001, 47-48.</li>\n<li>(10) Black 2001, 45-83.</li>\n<li>(11) Cervani, 400-401; see the bibliopgraphy for editions I have examined.</li>\n<li>(12) Black 2001, 48-62 and 2007, 44-47.</li>\n<li>(13) Ortalli 1993, 60-65.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Aelius Donatus was one of the many writers between the second and the fourth century who helped preserve classical Latin for later ages by composing formal grammars.

Clearly, it was ingrained in the practice of schoolmasters, and its packaging remained traditionalizing. (25) It may even have become a trademark of sorts for self-consciously old-fashioned pedagogues. A copy printed at Milan in 1611, for example, survives in the same binding as the comparably old-fashioned intermediate grammar by Gian Alberto Bossi (ca. 1450-ca. 1512) also printed in 1611. (26) This context is interesting since Bossi's grammar was largely forgotten until the middle of the sixteenth century, but then it was repeatedly published at Milan for the use of students <em>not</em> enrolled in the fashionable Jesuit college of the Brera.</p>\n<p>The publisher of the 1611 <em>Ianua</em> was copying a pretty, medievalizing package that had originated a few years earlier in Milan. (27) The style marks it as elementary material by contrast to slightly more advanced grammar book of Bossi. This Donat has no title page. Instead, a caption title in red appears on the first page, which is also adorned with bold black borders. The title announced that the booklet (of forty leaves in a single gathering, the cheapest possible format) contained the Donat and the Cato for school use recently and punctiliously corrected for students of all sorts. The remainder of the book was similarly ornamented, and it contained some additional texts not announced in the title. There was a second set of catechetical grammar drills, a list of vocabulary words, an alphabet table with a few phrases to be read in Italian, and on the back cover, lists of things to do at morning and evening devotions. This 1611 booklet is the exact typographical and ornamental equivalent of the red-and-black Jenson Donat of 1478, proving that in some circles tastes in layout and design were almost as conservative as pedagogical practices.</p>\n<p>Although the Donat or <em>Ianua</em> clearly dominated the elementary teaching of grammar in Italy, the advent of printing made other texts easily available both at this exact, very basic level and for the next, intermediate steps in learning Latin. Some succeeded in rivaling the traditional Donat while others did not. The <em>Ars minor</em> of Aelius Donatus -- the real Donatus -- was never a contender on the Italian market. It was printed frequently in Northern Europe, where it was a standard elementary classroom text. Over three hundred editions dating before 1501 are known but only four were printed in Italy, and it is possible that some of these were intended for use in Germany. (28) An edition printed at Venice in 1495 combined the <em>Ars minor</em> catechetical text with the prologue usual on the Italian Pseudo-Donatus, that is, the twelve-line poem beginning <em>Ianua sum rudibus....</em> If this odd combination was an experiment in introducing the genuine Donatus text to the Italian school market, it failed. Neither in manuscript nor in print did the genuine <em>Ars minor</em> ever have much influence on Italian pedagogy.

The pedagogy of these texts will concern us only slightly (and has been extensively treated by others). (31) But the place these humanist alternatives held in the market is worth consideration here. Most fifteenth-century grammatical authors in Italy began with the desire to replace the text most often taught in medieval schoolrooms just after the Donat, namely the <em>Doctrinale</em> of Alexander of Villa Dei. This verse grammar composed in 1199 was popular both north and south of the Alps. Although the book was admired for its coverage and considered useful because its verses were easily memorized, humanists criticized its vocabulary and style, which seemed to them perniciously medieval. They even portrayed Alexander as a living enemy, so entrenched was the habit of teaching from this text and so strongly did they feel that it delivered the wrong message. As Giovanni Francesco Boccardo Pilade (d. 1505) put it, Alexander made a good humanist want to vomit.

It is used to unusually good effect in this case. While many red-and-black books merely alternate the colors for purely decorative effect or to emphasize a few headings, the Leto Donat uses red ink in a much more complex way. Red is used for many of the words that are subjects of discussion in the question-and-answer sections. In discussing personal pronouns, for example, the student is given the words <em>ego</em>, <em>nos</em>, <em>tu</em>, and <em>uos</em> in red at the left margin and the questions and answers that concern them are in black just to the right. [fol. 21v] Similarly the conjugation of <em>amo</em> is displayed in several column-format paragraphs across three pages. A typical one begins with a black bracket to divide the verb tenses -- present, past imperfect, past perfect, etc. -- which are named below the bracket in black. Beneath each tense is the corresponding form of <em>amo</em>, also in black, but introduced by the word <em>ut</em> (\"such as\") in red. Below this diagram, each of the sample words is then repeated in red at the right margin, and in a separate column to the left are arranged the questions and answers to be drilled. Thus: \"<em>Amo</em> [in red]: What is its tense? Present. How so? Because the present tense designates an action or passion.\" [6r-7v] These diagram-form paradigms are supplements to the traditional Donat, since the common <em>Ianua</em>-text of this section, rehearsing the conjugation of <em>amo</em> on an additional three pages, is also present. [8r-9r] In these sections giving the traditional text of <em>Ianua</em>, red ink is employed only for the first letters of paragraphs, a much more typical red-and-black usage. As a result, teachers familiar with the common teaching text could quickly and easily see the interpolated material in this edition; and students seeing it for the first time would also be able to discern that there are two sections that drill each major inflectional paradigm.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/2.00_Chapter_Two/HFS_057.01.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/2.00_Chapter_Two/HFS_057.01.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Red &amp; black for beginners; a Donat of 1500 (click to enlarge - 464 KB JPEG image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>The practice of ornamenting in red and black has a complex history. (21) Most often used in the fifteenth century for liturgical and law books, it had been extended to some schoolbooks in the course of the fourteen eighties and nineties at Venice, chiefly for those at the most elementary level like the syllabary and the Donat. Along with the use of floral or figural woodcut borders and initials, red-and-black printing was an attempt to prettify the books offered to children. A 1478 Donat by Nicolas Jenson is the first documented example of red-and-black printing specifically for the school market in Venice, but it did not become common in elementary books until the late fourteen eighties, when Teodoro Ragazzoni began printing and reprinting the Donat in a red-and-black format that was obviously a marketing success. The style, whether for the Donat or for other very basic texts like arithmetics, had a long subsequent life in the Adriatic metropolis and was copied elsewhere, though it never became standard for grammar books as a whole and rarely rose to the level of sophistication displayed by the Leto/De Gregori Donat.</p>\n<p>An interesting example of the application of red-and-black beyond the Donat is in editions of Aldo Manuzio's Latin grammar. Aldo's grammar, first printed in 1493, was repeatedly revised until 1514 in an attempt to replace both the Donat and the commonly used intermediate grammar of Alexander of Villa Dei, the <em>Doctrinale</em>. Aldo offered a comprehensive treatment, intended to accompany students from their first reading of Latin through their school years and to serve as a reference book thereafter. He also included materials for a first course in Greek. Thus, he provided a full set of prayers in Latin and Greek, a few short Bible passages, a tabular syllabary for practicing the reading of syllables, and a systematic grammar that works from simple to complex concepts. Aldo apparently thought that the modern student should skip the Donat and avoid the <em>Doctrinale</em> altogether.

These few leaves contain the prayers and the syllabary, exactly the materials that would have been given to the very beginning students in the reading course. It constituted a sort of primer, effectively separable from the rest of the book. A book printed this way may in fact have been intended to be distributed in parts. The first gathering could have been put in the hands of elementary students who would only later see the next, intermediate grammar text. For the remainder of the book, including the question-and-answer portions parallel to the Donat exercises, the Giunta employed a straightforward, all-black style, indicating that the student had now progressed to Latin study and therefore deserved to have a book in an adult style. This practice of printing a separable primer in red and black at the beginning of Aldo's grammar was carried forward by other printers, including Aldo's heir Andrea Torresano. (23) Aldo's son Paolo Manuzio dropped it in his editions of Aldo's grammar after 1558. The practice had meanwhile become mere formula, however, since as early as 1543 we find an edition printed by Francesco Bindoni where the red-and-black style is used only in the first gathering even though the syllabary, a part of the primer for which the style was introduced, runs fully four pages into the second gathering.

In the early fourteen seventies, a few large quartos were offered, especially at Rome, as an alternative to the folios without commentary. Alessandro Paganino produced an experimental quarto Terence in 1526 as part of a textbook series. And in the fifteen forties and fifties, a few further experiments in quarto were attempted at Venice.

The handsome roman title is surrounded by a broad white-on-gray interlace border of a sort that was used repeatedly by Paganino for quarto textbooks in Latin.

Tacuino had arranged the scenes four across in two rows at the top of the page that opened each play. Paganino had the very same eight scenes per play copied onto a full-page woodcut with two frames in each of four rows. This scheme created a handsome page to act as a frontispiece for each of the plays. Like the Tacuino strips, Paganino's were more decorative than useful, but they did fit the quarto format nicely and relieved the overall effect of the crowded text pages.</p>\n<p>There were hundreds of octavo editions of Terence in the sixteenth century. The recorded quartos, however, are few, and all are Venetian imprints. After Paganino in 1526, only Girolomo Scotto in 1549, Giovanni Andrea Valvassore in 1550, and Vincenzo Valgrisi in 1558 experimented with the quarto format for the standard Terence with commentaries. We might well ask why Terence was never published in Italy after 1480 in a spacious quarto without commentary. This form was normal for all kinds of classical and contemporary poetry before Aldo Manuzio offered his popular octavos, and it continued to be used for many kinds of poetry well into the sixteenth century. The simplest answer is probably that the Aldine octavo swept competitors for this kind of book from the market for classical poetry. In the case of Terence, the strong tradition of folio Terences with and without commentary no doubt also contributed to the limited demand for other formats.

A 1583 Piacenza edition attributed new revisions to Antonio Bendinelli, but it basically followed Palmieri's text closely except for adding a few examples. Bendinelli replaced the Greek alphabet at the end with an extract from one of Cicero's letters and an extended diagrammatic paradigm for the verb <em>esse</em>. The publisher claimed on the title page that Bendinelli not only corrected the text but also arranged it better. This last claim was a real selling point in that the typography is unusually spacious. The paradigms are set in a graceful, formal manner accentuated by two-line woodcut initials. The booklet also boasts purely ornamental cuts borrowed from more ambitious books. The title page displays a madonna and child surrounded by angels; there is a naÃ¯ve, half-page cut of a knight on fol. E2 labeled \"S. Antonino;\" and every chapter begins with a handsome initial showing a mythological or biblical figure.</p>\n<p>By the end of the sixteenth century, publishers usually treated Guarino's grammar as they did the Donat, as an old-fashioned text, distinctly down-market by comparison with more modern grammars. The 1596 Florence edition already mentioned was formatted exactly like a Donat that issued from the same Sermartelli press in the next year. We may imagine that they were intended for the same unambitious schools. The printer used the same type for the Guarino as for the Donat, but crowded the page even more than in the beginners' grammar. Then toward the end, at the point where the common text of Guarino changes from prose to verse, the printer changed type too, employing an ugly little roman and jamming forty two lines on each quarto page. (43)</p>\n<p>Marco Antonio Bonciari (1555-1616) worked yet another revision upon Guarino in the last decade of the sixteenth century, proposing it as a basic textbook for the newly founded Seminary College of Saint Bernard at Perugia where he was professor of humanities. As a first stage he cleaned up and re-edited the Palmieri text and added a drilling book for irregular verb forms. (44) Later he enlarged this basic textbook under the title <em>Guarinus, Or, Introduction to the Latin Language</em>, effectively turning Guarino's name into the title of the textbook. This appeared in 1597-1598 together with a reprint of the drill book for irregular forms and another drilling book for all the noun and verb paradigms, called <em>Donatus and Guarinus Corrected, Enlarged, and Illustrated</em>. All three booklets were presented in a handsome small octavo on blue paper. Bonciari also published a rhetoric textbook for the same school, and he turned</p>\n<p>Bonciari's <em>Guarinus</em> seems to have had considerable success. It was republished many times as late as 1694; the <em>Donatus and Guarinus</em> drilling book appeared as late as 1698. Meanwhile, the Roman teacher Giovanni Battista Corradi (fl. 1644-1681) prepared an enlarged version of the traditional Donat with Bonciari's Guarino under the title <em>Bonciarius adultus</em>, by which he meant a fuller and more mature version of Bonciari. So Bonciari himself, like Guarino and Donatus, became a title as well as an author. Still later, Corradi added translations of the base texts and extensive commentary, calling the resulting work <em>Aelius Donatus the Roman, or rather, Concerning All Grammar, Latin and Vernacular</em>. He dedicated this book to three young princes of the Altemps family, presenting it as if it were a textbook though, at over eight hundred pages, it seems unlikely to have been used by many students. (46)</p>\n<p>The fact that Bonciari and Corradi linked the revised text of Guarino's grammar with a similarly corrected and clarified version of the traditional Donat was not a novelty. Guarino himself seems to have expected that his work would be used as a follow up to memorizing Pseudo-Donatus; and printers often offered the two texts in combined form in one book or in paired editions printed to the same pattern. Giovanni Tacuino, for example, offered a Guarino uniform in style with Antonio Mancinelli's <em>Better Donat</em> in 1507. In 1511 Bernardino Benali did the same. Benali's Donat is printed in red and black and his Guarino in black only, but they use the same types and both have first sheets decorated with religious woodcuts reused from missals or books of hours. A more direct model for Bonciari and Corradi might have been a combined edition prepared by Giovanni Battista Spina (dates unknown) and printed at Rome by the prestigious Salviani firm in 1579. Spina imagined that Guarino himself had edited the Donat, so he called his book <em>The Grammatical Rudiments of Aelius Donatus Once Digested by Guarino and Now Restored by Giovanni Battista Spina</em>. The book is a tour-de-force of red and black printing but offers a traditional version of both the Donat and Guarino's <em>Regulae</em>.

Pilade himself had attempted this before authoring a detailed critique of everything he found objectionable in the <em>Doctrinale</em>. (33) The most influential of the new intermediate grammars were those of Guarino Guarini Veronese (1374-1460) and Niccolò Perotti (1430 -1480). Guarino began work on his grammar textbook in the second decade of the fifteenth century, designing a concise prose grammar in a deliberate attempt to counter the prolix verse of the <em>Doctrinale</em>. He took over and simplified descriptive terms for noun and verb morphology that had been developing for a century or more in the Italian schools and exemplified each rule with good classical examples. Guarino's grammar was praised by other humanists (many of them his own students), and it came to have wide circulation in Italy as an intermediate grammar book. (34) Like the Donat, however, the text was not stable, since before the advent of printing there was no common or vulgate text, merely versions prepared by individual teachers for their own classrooms. Writing in 1459, Guarino's son Battista complained of these elaborations and modifications.

Since the common printed text of Guarino's grammar was fairly summary, editors and printers throughout the sixteenth century felt free to add materials. Following some incunable editions and perhaps also in imitation of Aldo Manuzio's grammar of 1493, Palmieri added a Greek alphabet to fill out the last leaf of his 64-page booklet.

Indeed the Donat may very well be what he meant by \"foolish primers\" (<em>insulsa rudimenta</em>). Although deeply ingrained in the traditional curriculum, the Donat proved problematical for many humanist teachers. At first they complained primarily about its style -- limping prose stuffed with odd words, many of them medieval and not classical. This general concern had motivated the work of Guarino and Perotti. (66) Later teachers also criticized <em>Ianua</em> as too difficult for beginners to understand. This change in critique probably reflects the changing way the Donat was used in the classroom. Medieval students had parroted the verses mechanically to start with and then in a second part of the course repeated them with their teacher's explication, for comprehension. The first humanists seemed to have accepted this standard method, merely chafing a little at the bad Latin that embodied it. Later humanist masters took a more integrated approach to teaching Latin; they wanted their students to learn simple, pure classical vocabulary from the start, and they did not want them to begin with an ill-comprehended text. Only if students could recognize the meaning of the text immediately could they eventually come to love the language. Robert Black sees this humanist ideal contributing to the increasing marginalization of the Donat and its relegation to the reading course; he cites as evidence the increasing number of humanist grammars after 1480 that include basic paradigms that once were learned only with the Donat. (67) At least one sixteenth-century humanist, Stefano Piazzoni (dates unknown), made a concerted effort to correct the Donat and provide it with better declensional paradigms. He seems to have had his own students in Venice in mind.

Sulpizio probably intended his work to be called <em>Opus grammaticum</em>, but it circulated under several other titles, most often just <em>Regulae Sulpitii</em>. It was often printed together with the author's work on prosody (commonly <em>Scansiones Sulpitii</em>) and the two works in effect cover an entire intermediate Latin grammar course. Sulpizio expressly said his book was to be given to students right after the Donat; but he assumed that they have little understanding of the inflectional paradigms. He did not give the students new paradigms to memorize, but he rehearsed the definitions of the parts of speech in an introductory poem to be memorized and then explained the regular structure of inflected forms at length. He also provided long lists of irregular forms to be memorized. In other words, he was repeating some basic material from the rote-memorized Donat but insisting it be thoroughly understood through repeated, intelligent drilling. Sulpizio made extensive use of mnemonic verses so the rules would be easier to digest. Although the book is presented in a format confusing to modern readers, with repeated prefaces, inserted passages from earlier grammarians, short reading texts, and irregular headings, it was popular with humanist teachers for its wealth of drilling materials. One of the reading texts, Sulpizio's own poem on table manners, was widely excerpted and anthologized by other authors.

Giovanni Tacuino printed the two works in an unusual format in 1495, with the title <em>Regulae Sulpitii</em> on an otherwise blank front page and <em>Scansione Sulpitii</em> on the corresponding back page, effectively creating a paper wrapper for the two books if purchased and bound together. Such packaging rather effectively labels the book as work of reference. (70) Later editions styled Sulpizio's grammar accurately enough as a <em>Grammaticae compendium</em>. In this form the book included a chapter on the figures of speech lifted directly from Aelius Donatus' <em>Ars maior</em> (and attributed to him), as well as the <em>De scansione</em>. Sometimes the parts were pulled apart again and issued in editions designed to accompany each other. The full anthology had many editions across fifty years in Italy and was used in Northern Europe as well. (71)</p>\n<p>Sulpizio's basic strategy -- accept the traditional Donat as unavoidable, but correct it immediately -- was adopted by many authors across the sixteenth century. But not all teachers found Sulpizio's multiplication of examples and drills a wise procedure. In Milan in 1599, Alessandro Rubini at Milan rejected several grammars then on the market and proposed his own <em>De grammaticis insitutionibus liber</em>. Even at this late date, he assumed his students would have memorized the Donat. His follow-up grammar gave a very limited number of clear, simple rules with a single example for each, \"lest the weak minds of boys be overwhelmed by a multitude of examples.\" (72) From this stage, they would go on to memorize additional rules and examples, or better yet to apply them directly in reading and construing proverbs and moral sayings.</p>\n<p>This practical development, denigrating the Donat by marginalizing it and minimizing its influence, was paralleled in the rhetoric of humanist teachers, who increasingly condemned the way in which the Donat supposedly destroyed any possible enjoyment of or appreciation for the Latin language. In the context of just such an exhortation to make Latin admirable to beginners, Francesco Priscianese (1495-1549) recommended his own short introductory grammar as a substitute for the Donat:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the Donat too (to speak freely the truth and what, as I believe, every good man would say who had thought about it for a while) is far too dry a thing for real beginners, and too weak, and (what is most important) too difficult, both for its language, which no one understands without a translator, and also for the material treated in difficult fashion, out of order, and strangely. So much so that one can almost say that he who knows the Donat, unless he already knew a great deal of what he now knows beforehand, knows nothing at all, or rather that if he does know something, does not know what he knows.

The Giunta at Florence, almost as if to make amends for the awful edition of 1543, gave the book a handsome, simple quarto edition in 1560. An abbreviated text in handy octavo came out in Venice in 1561, 1568, and 1579 \"liberated from innumerable errors by Borgaruccio Borgarucci.\" (60) The claim that the many earlier printings were badly inaccurate became a refrain in late-century editions, but it is hard to say exactly what it meant in marketing terms. It may be that the many Perottis printed early in the sixteenth century had acquired so bad a reputation for the quality of their text that this fact had contributed to the book's ceasing to be published regularly, with the further result that printers had to claim to have edited the text anew to recapture a market for it. (61)</p>\n<p>On the other hand, for some of these later editions we can infer other considerations than the reputation of the book. For example, it seems likely that Giorgio Marescotti's 1582 edition was part of his (ultimately unsuccessful) campaign to become official printer to the Grand Dukes of Tuscany. He gave Perotti's grammar a new preface that seems more than a little defensive about the whole project. Marescotti first reminded his readers of Perotti's century-long reputation. He then backtracked a bit, saying that, however old-fashioned, the book was still likely to be useful to the youths of Florence. He was claiming to be a servant of the Florentine state by printing a classic of humanist scholarship and pedagogy. He also claimed that he had decided to base his text not on any recent edition but on early ones, implying that he used an edition or manuscript close to the author's own text. (62) Although Perotti's grammar was not much reprinted in Italy after 1560, we know that it was still on the market much later and in use in some schools well into the seventeenth century.

Brief but otherwise typical is that of Giovanni Calfurnio (1433-1503) which appeared in Venetian editions from 1478 onward and with increasing frequency toward the end of the century. Calfurnio praised Perotti in general terms as one of those modern scholars who revived the beautiful Latin of ancient times, and specifically for having composed a grammar that would substitute for \"certain foolish primers and over-dense grammars with which boys were taught falsely.\" (64) Over-density is an interesting charge, since the <em>Rudimenta</em> is also chock full of things to memorize. Calfurnio probably meant that Perotti's work is relatively more concerned with vocabulary and less with multiplying rules than it predecessors. Calfurnio went on to name the <em>Doctrinale</em> among the worthless textbooks: \"Nor do I see what possible excuse those who employ the silly poem of barbarous Alexander can henceforth give.\" (65)</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(60) Borgarucci would go on to a significant career in Venice as an editor of classical texts, see DBI 12:567.</li>\n<li>(61) This may be the import of an application for a new privilege to print Perotti \"in meliore forma\" presented to the Venetian Senate in 1526; see Fulin 1882a, 206.

It was the most successful Latin grammar authored in the fifteenth century. (48) Perotti begins with the usual presentations of morphology and syntax, employing mostly classical examples, and then goes on to a section on letter-writing which is actually an ambitious introduction to stylistics. Letter writing had long been the excuse for Italian schoolmasters to teach Latin style, but Perotti broke with the formulaic medieval tradition of <em>ars dictaminis</em> and presented the letter as an opportunity to master proper Ciceronian Latin. (49) Perotti's approach to grammar -- as a discipline that embraces morphology, syntax, and stylistics in one integrated course -- would set the measure for grammarians' marketing ambitions for several centuries. From Perotti onward, many publishers and printers looked to produce packages of grammatical texts that would either embrace an entire course of grammatical study or else correspond to parts of an integrated grammar course. (50)</p>\n<p>Perotti also attempted to enliven the course with direct addresses to the student. Even more remarkably he claimed to abandon the medieval notion that grammatical rules are worth memorizing in and of themselves. He wanted his students to master classical style through the analysis of classical usage. To this end he defined grammar in a new way, as the art of speaking and writing well based on the observation of writers and poets worth imitating, especially the authors from Cicero to Pliny the Younger. (51) Perotti was influenced by the resounding success of the <em>Elegantia</p>\n<p>More than rules, Perotti invited his students to memorize long lists of words that occur in classical literature. We know from early annotations in editions of Perotti, moreover, that these vocabulary lists were attractive and useful. These sections of the grammar served as hooks on which owners of Perotti's book could hang notes from their own readings of classical authors. Annotations of this sort effectively rewrote the grammar book, making it over from a standard-issue word list into a personalized dictionary of usage as observed by the individual humanist reader. (53)</p>\n<p>In their work of annotating Perotti, readers were helped along by the format of the printed book, although it is clear that Perotti's own manuscript fair copy was formatted for study and consultation in an even more thorough way than the earliest editions. (54) Perotti numbered the rules in each section of his grammar and used other mnemonic devices derived from teaching practice. (55) Printers dealt with these innovations with differing degrees of success. Early editions used broad margins and centered, all-caps section heads to imitate the spacious look of humanist manuscripts. This was true whether the printed book was in quarto, imitating small-format manuscript schoolbooks, or in folio, more closely resembling larger and more luxurious humanist manuscripts. The numbering of the rules was emphasized by centering even simple heads like \"First rule on supines,\" \"Second rule,\" etc. (56)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/2.00_Chapter_Two/HFS_116.02.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/2.00_Chapter_Two/HFS_116.02.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Perotti's word lists in quarto format (Click to enlarge - 662 KB JPEG image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Early printers set up Perotti's long lists of vocabulary words in columns that clarify their inflectional patterns, variable roots, and meanings. For example, Perotti invited his students to memorize forty-five third declension transitive deponent verbs. He placed a tabulated list of them within the text. It gives the first person singular in present, perfect, and past perfect form and an equivalent meaning for each verb. In one early quarto edition this tabulated list occupies almost two full pages. The same layout in large-format editions could take up well over a folio page. Such layouts, of course, were prodigal of paper and resulted in relatively bulky and expensive books. (57)</p>\n<p>More economical editions of Perotti began to appear around 1480, typically using smaller type and closer settings on quarto pages. This style never entirely replaced the earlier, more spacious editions, but the general trend was to abandon the humanist manuscript ideal in favor of denser, more utilitarian layouts. There is little doubt that the move to smaller formats was market-driven; booksellers wanted to have more than one version on offer. (58)</p>\n<p>Instead of centering the heading for each rule, the cheaper editions set the text in solid paragraphs and simply indicated the start of each rule with a section or paragraph mark ( Â¶ ). They preserved the tabulated word lists, but sometimes squeezed them in, using far less white space. (59) Almost immediately after Perotti's death, moreover, editions began to appear in black-letter types instead of the romans that more closely imitated humanist manuscripts. Other printers mixed roman and black-letter. Such editions appear first at Reggio Emilia, Milan and Rome. After the turn of the century, some Venetian editions also appear with mixed black-letter and roman. The trend toward more economical editions probably reflects the increasingly widespread use of Perotti in classrooms. The cheapening of the book culminated in a Florentine edition of 1543 in which the Giunta firm, which usually turned out handsome products, presented Perotti in a particularly crowded and homely layout. They used cracked and worn woodblocks, badly locked up forms, and sloppy inking.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(48) The <em>Rudimenta</em> went through hundreds of editions in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.

It was only a short step from annotating thoroughly to compiling the annotations in print for the use of other teachers and students. Early models of the eventual print genre were provided by little synonym dictionaries like that (ostensibly based on Cicero) known to Coluccio Salutati (1331-1406). (68) The Neapolitan grammar master Lucio Giovanni Scoppa (d. ca. 1551) provided more detailed and better documented anthologies for students early in the sixteenth century with his <em>Collectanea in diversos auctores</em> and <em>Spicilegium</em>, two aids to Latin composition with elaborate indexes. (69) Cicero and Terence, mainstays of the intermediate Latin class and so the first \"difficult\" authors many students would encounter, were naturals for treatment in this way. In the case of Terence the lists usually appeared in appendixes to student editions. Cicero's vocabulary was sometimes treated in separate volumes for advanced students. (70)</p>\n<p>Latin vocabulary lists based on single authors could help first-time readers of these texts, but even more importantly they were intended to help composition students to imitate the style and usage of widely admired authors. (71) Terence was considered the best possible model for spoken Latin, so humanists like Cornelius de Schryver (1482-1558) compiled excerpts aimed specifically at helping students speak fluently. (72) Not surprisingly, the production of vocabulary and style excerpts was linked to the compilation of collections of proverbs and sayings (<em>sententiae</em> or <em>dicta</em>). Proverb collections could be Latin-only, Latin-and-vernacular, or vernacular-only anthologies. The most successful Italian author of such compilations was Niccolò Liburnio (ca. 1474-1557). Liburnio was a humanistically trained cleric, poet, and prolific translator. He worked at least briefly in the printing house of Aldo Manuzio, and composed several works on Latin and Italian stylistics. Liburnio published his first compendia of sayings in Italian in the fifteen twenties for the use of layfolk who wanted to achieve a veneer of verbal culture in the vernacular. (73) By 1537 he was assembling philosophical commonplaces from Greek and Latin writers (including Cicero and Terence) which were widely imitated. Obviously, the genre was not highly original to start with and it was easy to knock off a new collection by simply rearranging or re-titling an old one. So <em>dicta notabilia, elegantiae, dogmata philosophica, gemmae, selectiores et puriores formulae</em> abounded.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/HFS_098.01.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/1.00_Chapter_One/HFS_098.01.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Advertising erudition (click to enlarge - 805 KB JPEG image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Even truly learned Latinists like Bartolomeo Ricci (1490-1560) and Aldo Manuzio the Younger (1547-1587) assembled collections of extracts from Cicero and Terence.

Most early attempts foundered on the unmoving rocks of conservative educational practice. Guarino's brief prose grammar, a never-published verse grammar by Lorenzo Valla, and a series of short treatises by Pomponio Leto all intended to substitute for some of the material in the Donat, or at least to correct it at a very early stage. We have already seen this pattern in the case of Giovanni Sulpizio, who, like Valla and Leto, formed part of the coterie of Rome-based philologists who can be credited with a genuine humanist reform of grammar teaching. (74) Into the seventeenth century, printers were still designing pairs of textbooks to be sold together -- the Donat and Guarino's grammar or the Donat and some other local favorite. (75)</p>\n<p>Giovanni Battista Cantalicio (ca. 1450-1514?) composed a successful short grammar which seems to have been intended to substitute entirely for the Donat. It appeared in over forty editions between 1493 and 1613, usually under a title that clearly defines its content and method, <em>A Most Useful Compendium of all Latin Grammar and Metrical Art Divided into Rules</em>. (76) Cantalicio relied on short lists of brief rules, expressly tailored to the limited memory of younger students. His work may be taken as a criticism of the lengthy and obscure rule-making of the Donat. Cantalicio's grammar was advanced in terms of layout, especially for the paradigms. This fact probably reflects his own ideas about type and design. Indeed, his preface is a letter of complaint about the work of its first printer (for a Foligno edition that does not seem to survive). The book's publishers reprinted this preface in every edition I have seen. It functioned primarily as an example of Cantalicio's elegant prose. But the printers may also have taken its sentiments to heart, for the layout of the book and even the style of ornament is remarkably consistent throughout its long life in print.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/2.00_Chapter_Two/Case-X-647.55,-Institvtionvm-grammaticarvm-libri-qvatvor,-ti.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/2.00_Chapter_Two/Case-X-647.55,-Institvtionvm-grammaticarvm-libri-qvatvor,-ti.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Aldo Manuzio reprinted in 1519 (click to enlarge - 683 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Aldo Manuzio also proposed to substitute for the Donat entirely, with a comprehensive Latin-language textbook composed from scratch.

Petri stitched together a more or less complete basic course composed entirely of texts and extracts from classical sources. His choice for a first grammar was the <em>Regulae</em> of (Pseudo-)Rhemnius Palaemon. This brief text bore the name of a second-century grammarian, though it is now believed to have been written in the fourth century. It was discovered and assigned to Palaemon in the middle of the fifteenth century by Giovanni Gioviano Pontano (1426-1503). Scholars in the circle of Pomponio Leto, the so-called Accademia Romana, copied and studied it. (80)</p>\n<p>Petri briefly introduced the text by situating it as an ancient one rediscovered in modern times. Moreover, he says, Palaemon beat Aelius Donatus at his own game:</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This man [Palaemon] compacted the whole of grammar into so brief a package that even Donatus is more prolix than he, and some day he may come to have as enduring a name. Gioviano Pontano, a poet most eloquent in his own day, discovered this text.

This role, Petri says, is better played by Palaemon than by Donatus who in the common mind is synonymous with the brief introduction. (82)</p>\n<p>The surviving Pseudo-Palaemon text, however, only presented grammatical information about nouns and pronouns. Petri therefore filled it out with a patchwork of grammatical doctrines by such late antique authors as Quintus Terentius Scaurus, Aelius Donatus, and Marius Victorinus. In a preface Petri described these authors briefly with their credentials in terms of ancient or modern opinions; as a minimum he gave a clear statement of the time at which they wrote. Thus, Petri managed to provide the basics of a full grammar course without ever having to employ the teachings of any suspiciously modern grammarian, and he also laid the foundation for his student public to understand the importance of ancient Latin usage as the creation of a specific historical period. The result was slightly repetitive, but no more so than seemed useful in the elementary classroom. It is a tour-de-force of antiquarian pastiche.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(74) D'Amico 1983, 91-102; Rizzo 1996, 16-18; Rizzo and De Nonno 1997, 1597-1598; Black 2001, 137-139.</li>\n<li>(75) There are many examples.

One obscure effort (obscure because few copies of any of his books survive) was that of Pietro Cittadella (d. 1554). A Paduan poet and probably also a schoolteacher, Cittadella authored a grammar in 1535 in which he proposed a question-and-answer teaching system. He gave a fifty-odd concise rules to be memorized, and then proceeded to exercise the students with close explications of short sentences. The sample sentences (each called a <em>thema</em>) were presented in both Latin and Italian so that there would be no doubt as to their meaning. Then the students were quizzed by the teacher in an <em>examen</em> that proceeded through the <em>thema</em> word by word, asking about parts of speech, meanings, inflectional forms, and syntactical relationships. The student was to answer using the descriptive vocabulary of the brief, memorized rules. The book was printed very roughly and inelegantly and its preface promised a fuller treatment in a longer book on the parts of speech (apparently never published). Since Cittadella called his book a <em>methodus</em>, it is possible that he merely intended it for a demonstration piece.</p>\n<p>The most radical reformers suggested teaching Latin entirely in Italian. An early exponent was the Veronese humanist Bernardino Donato (1483-1543) whose <em>Grammatica latina in volgare</em> saw a single edition in 1529. It is notable for its front matter where Donato remarked that since arithmetic, astrology, medicine and philosophy could be studied in Italian, it was time to make Latin study available in that form too.

Priscianese does not seem to have started with the intention of replacing the Donat, though he ended up claiming to have done so. His comprehensive descriptive grammar of Latin, composed in standard Tuscan, appeared in 1540. He believed that it would be easier and more agreeable for students to study the ancient language across the entire course if their handbook were written in the modern vernacular. He also opined that bilingual study is of benefit for mastery of both languages, enriching the vernacular by the example of Latin eloquence and making Latin more easily understandable. For realizing these goals in the form of a grammar, he was praised by several members of the Tuscan community in Rome, including Michelangelo Buonarotti. (83) Only in a second moment, Priscianese tells us, did he decide to make an abbreviation of his grammar as a direct substitute for the Donat. Perhaps inevitably, this substitute for the book that Florentines commonly called the Donadello came to be called the Priscianello, a marketing device that pointed out in a word that it was to be used to substitute for the Donat. Its modernity was its selling point. (84)</p>\n<p>By 1550, then, there were so many alternatives in print that the grip of the Donat was loosening.

Since it was a collection of moral sayings in more or less classical Latin, the Cato could be embraced by grammarians with many teaching styles. (85) The early humanists particularly valued it as an open window on the morality of the ancient world. Because it was an elementary text, moreover, the Cato was exempt from the broader humanist critique of medieval florilegia. From Petrarch onwards, the Italian humanists rebelled against the scholastic practice, embodied in popular preaching as well, of excerpting pithy sayings as themes for new composition without regard for their proper literary and moral contexts. This practice amounted to treating the sayings as authoritative individually and in themselves rather than understanding their authors as creators of morally integral works of literature. (86)</p>\n<p>The Cato, however, was accepted by the humanists as an integrated work in its own right. Its anthologic nature was simply part of its elementary character. Heinrich Bebel, one of the most eloquent spokesmen for Italian humanist educational ideas in Germany, contrasted the Cato with the other moralizing poetry usually given to school boys. He concluded (on the authority of Lorenzo Valla) that it is highly salutary and written in excellent Latin, even if it is not to be attributed to the historical Cato. Moreover, he forbade teachers to read other \"minor authors\" (he meant the medieval schoolroom poets) with their students:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In conclusion, all versifiers and minor authors are to be avoided by those who are eager to acquire eloquence and especially by those of tender age, unless they are authors who have written bountifully and elegantly on a pleasant and moral subject. I make exception as well for the book ascribed to \"Cato.\" For no one in a thousand years, says Valla, has written a more elegant Latin poem than the author of this book. ... And the book itself may well be called \"a Cato\" for its gravity and integrity, on which account works known as \"Catos\" are celebrated with the highest praise. (87)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The issue for Bebel, as it had been for Valla and other early Italian humanists, was that students in the traditional scholastic curriculum absorbed bad Latin and chancy morals all at once. In humanist schools, they would instead learn both good usage and moral commonplace thought. (88)</p>\n<p>As the Counter-Reformation proceeded, teachers stressed more and more that the Cato was only one introduction to commonplace moral thinking. It was properly complemented by prayers, scripture passages, and simple devotional texts that would add a Christian dimension to the most elementary instruction. Angelo Turchini notes that by the turn of the seventeenth century teachers urgently maintained that the ancients were superior to modern men in eloquence but not in matters of religion or morals. Some authors of new grammars insisted that students should advance as early as possible to reading moral texts.

Erasmi Rotterdami</em>). This booklet was one of several textbooks Erasmus published in 1514, probably as a money-making expedient. (103) It is a new package for the Cato, including the familiar distichs with the base text as corrected by Josse Bade, further tweaked by Erasmus, and enhanced by a paraphrase commentary. But, as ad men say, there is also much much more: a medieval translation of the Cato into Greek by Maximus Planudes (ca. 1230-ca. 1310) designed for Byzantine schoolboys and here edited by Erasmus; three other small collections of philosophers' sayings; Erasmus's poem on Christian education; and the <em>Paraenesis</em> of Isocrates, a collection of hortatory commonplaces. This package was offered for relatively young readers; but, since the texts are in both Latin and Greek, it seems likely that Erasmus also intended it for use in schools across several years. Like many other basic schoolbooks, this reading anthology sets up the expectation that it will be a useful moral reference life-long, both because it will be</p>\n<p>This Cato represents, moreover, a small installment in Erasmus's ongoing project of collecting and commenting proverbs, his <em>Sayings</em> (<em>Adagia</em>), which first appeared in 1500 and was continuously revised and enlarged until his death. The <em>Adagia</em> began as a sort of schoolbook too, as did another many-times-revised phrase book, <em>On Abundance of Words and Things</em> (<em>De utraque rerum ac verborum copia</em>). Modern critics have recognized that for Erasmus the proverb or adage was an historically situated literary artifact that could be immensely fruitful both of eloquence and of wisdom. Erasmus's Cato remained an elementary schoolbook, in keeping with its traditional place in the curriculum, while the <em>De copia</em> and the <em>Adagia</em> multiplied beyond their original dimensions into full-fledged monuments of humanist erudition. All three books stood in the tradition of rhetorical study as a pursuit of wisdom. Aphorisms and proverbs especially were closely associated with moral philosophy and with a tradition of prayerful meditation. In humanist hands the ethically succinct proverb could expand almost to a moral infinity. Even a teaching tool of the most elementary sort had this potential, and Erasmus' version of the Cato was already an expanded collection.

His highly successful packages were then imported back to Italy by Venetian printers who proposed them for use in Italian schools in just the form we have seen, as teacher's manuals. I have found no evidence that these rather elaborate Venetian books were actually given to students in Italy, though some Paris editions by Josse Bade do bear marks of ownership by students. These fully annotated editions of elementary texts really represent an attempt to provide the humanist schoolmaster with books that will serve as reference aids (cribs, even) for his teaching. If we imagine that the target book buyer was a provincial teacher at an elementary level, we can see that these books were also intended to package the pretensions of such teachers to erudition and to embody their ties to the great world of humanist philological scholarship. Bade's extensive commentary on Pseudo-Cato was offered in Italy as part of a collected edition of the works of a famous <em>Italian</em> teacher of grammar, Antonio Mancinelli (1452-1506). The resulting package linked its humble, small-town buyer to the glorious tradition of Italian humanist scholarship, to the Roman Academy of which Mancinelli was a member, and to the pan-European world of humanism that had embraced the Italian achievement.</p>\n<p>To judge from the bibliographical record, scholarly editions of Pseudo-Cato would seem to have far outnumbered reading or student editions in the early years of printing. But this is an illusion created by survival rates and bibliographical practice. Annotated Catos survive in relatively large numbers because they were more substantial, had longer working lives, and so seemed more worth binding up; they were also distinct enough to have their own place in modern bibliographies. By contrast the small versions of the Cato on a few leaves intended to be given to children have often disappeared without a trace or with just a mention in a printer's ledger or bookseller's inventory. The Cato printed specifically for children most often appeared in the same booklet with Pseudo-Donatus and, since Pseudo-Donatus precedes Pseudo-Cato, the modern bibliographical entries for such books are under Donatus.</p>\n<p>The Cato anthology came to the humanists already assembled; it was fully traditional in medieval classrooms. On the model it offered, many humanists compiled other collections of moral sayings. In fact humanist schoolmasters seem to have felt that the new technology of printing afforded them opportunities to multiply the salutary effects of such collections by multiplying the collections themselves. Supplements to the Cato for schoolboys could be published easily and cheaply in any town with a printing press. With only a small investment a teacher could customize his basic Latin reading list with a great variety of texts that he wanted to teach. Almost always, these new anthologies included texts on Christian themes as well as the secular commonplaces included in the Cato itself.</p>\n<p>A good example of the form is the small collection published in provincial Fano in 1502 under the sponsorship of the Latin grammar master there, Lorenzo Astemio (ca 1435 - ca 1505). Astemio served as librarian to the Duke of Urbino before settling as grammar master in Fano. He probably copied texts for his personal use over the years and eventually worked them up into this little printed anthology for local school use. (100) It is highly miscellaneous, including patristic and humanist poetry on mythological, hagiographic, and even political themes. There are encomia of St. Paul, St. Francis, St. John the Baptist, the Holy Cross, and the birth of Christ. The single largest number of texts are hymns in praise of the Virgin Mary. But Astemio also includes Petrarch's poem in praise of the Vaucluse, Lactantius on the phoenix, and a \"verse of the Sibyll on the signs of the last judgement.\" The contents really have in common only that they are short poetic pieces on salutary themes. Astemio says they teach both elegant diction and \"what is necessary for a pious life.\" (101) This theme, of course, is exactly the one Bebel attributed to the circle of Valla, that schoolboys should be given pleasant and salutary texts.</p>\n<p>Astemio's anthology bears no title (its first page is blank); but it's author and printer made some advertising claims in the prefatory letter. Astemio tells us that he persuaded printer Girolamo Soncino, newly arrived in Fano, that the first work to come from his press should be one for young people, and that it should be sold at a small price, not out of consideration for the poverty of the students but because it would be so much the more widely used and therefore more salutary. In effect, this elegant little letter is selling the humanist commonplace we have already seen so often, that a good education is an education to good moral habits and that all of society is served by such schooling. Astemio does not remark the fact that it might also have been prudent for the famous Jewish printer to publish a work of Christian piety just after the run-in with the Venetian authorities that had prompted him to move to Fano. Instead he commends Soncino's friendship with the Franciscans in the person of the Venetian dedicatee of the letter, Fra Francesco Zorzi. As a whole, this letter is perfect advertising. It labels the intended audience exactly and advertises the good intentions of all the members of the publishing team.

It circulated under the rubric <em>Catonis Disticha</em> because most of the proverbs it contained were two-line verses. There is no distinct Italian manuscript tradition; and the base texts in printed versions were much the same North and South of the Alps. Once the Cato text began to appear in elaborate editions with extensive annotations for teachers, it was common for these printed texts to cross the Alps, just as other scholarly books did. (90)</p>\n<p>We have already noted, however, that in Italy Pseudo-Cato often circulated together with the <em>Ianua</em> in a single manuscript booklet subsumed under the name of the Donat. In the North the <em>Ars minor</em> of Aelius Donatus and the Cato were usually treated as separate texts both in manuscripts and in early printed versions. In origin, the Donat and the Cato had different roles in the curriculum, since Aelius Donatus wrote a book of grammatical rules (and the Italian Donat was an equivalent set of rules), while the Cato was offered as a first literary reader. This functional distinction was preserved in Northern European printed editions. In the North, the Cato was often paired with the fables of Avianus. (91) Both these texts also appeared in an anthology of medieval elementary reading texts that was partly standardized before the introduction of printing and which circulated widely in print as the <em>Eight Authors</em> (<em>Auctores octo</em>). Many of these same school texts circulated in medieval Italy too, but not in standardized collections. (92) With the exception of the Cato, they were slowly eliminated from the curriculum by humanist teachers for exactly the reasons cited by Bebel -- bad Latin and insufficient attention to simple, commonplace moral themes. None of them appeared with the Cato in printed Italian editions. Instead, humanist teachers continued to use the Cato together with or immediately after Pseudo-Donatus and then went on to more complex reading texts in parallel with an intermediate grammar book. This was the pattern on the eve of the invention of printing, and it continued into the seventeenth century. The Donat -- in the sense of Pseudo-Donatus plus Pseudo-Cato -- became the standard printed package in Italy for the first course in Latin.

Though well printed and charmingly designed, this book is utterly traditional. Except for the advertisement implied in the red title, it offered the unelaborated Pseudo-Cato text that had been used in Italy for as long as anyone could remember. Interestingly, we know that Sessa was also offering a bilingual <em>Donato al senno</em> during the same years, that is, a non-traditional version of the same texts both in Latin and in Italian. (96)</p>\n<p>At the other end of book production for schools stands the fully annotated Cato printed in Venice by Giorgio Rusconi in 1518. This is a teacher's edition, in which the proverbs occupy not ten but 111 pages. The base text is set in small type and the notes for teachers are set even smaller. The Cato is one of three such traditional school texts in a 160-page booklet that was intended to stand at the front of a collected set of the works of Antonio Mancinelli. (97) The text of Pseudo-Cato was fixed by tradition; it is no longer here than in the pamphlet of 1500. The additional hundred pages contain a brief grammatical commentary by Mancinelli and much longer literary and moralizing notes by the editor, Josse Bade Ascensius. Between them, Mancinelli and Bade tried to imagine everything a teacher could possibly want to know or say to students about these texts. They routinely gave a paraphrase in natural (prose) word order of each proverb in poetry; and they supplied synonyms for unusual words. They pointed to problematic forms and indicate which ones are to be parsed in the classroom. Above all, they expanded on the moral meaning of each verse and</p>\n<p>Josse Bade, editor of this and many other schoolbooks, is a particular case whose career outside Italy nonetheless influenced Italian textbook publishing considerably. Born near Brussels and trained at Louvain, he taught school in Lyon and then became a successful printer at Paris. His commentary on the <em>Distichs of Cato</em> was a very thoroughgoing one, concentrating on the philological issues of vocabulary, inflectional form, and literary parallels. It was first printed at Lyon as part of a large compendium of moral texts and commentaries called <em>Sylvae morales</em> in 1492 by Bade's father-in-law, Jean Trechsel. It was re-issued as a separate in 1505 and 1517 by other printers, and in 1518, as we have seen, as part of the Venice collected edition of the works of Antonio Mancinelli. Finally Bade reprinted it partially himself in 1527 and 1533, incorporated into a version of Erasmus's Cato. It may very well be that Bade left off printing his own commentary as a separate out of admiration for the version of Erasmus, which Bade published in 1515, soon after its first appearance, and which he continued to print right up to his death.

Note that the text of Pseudo-Cato had been \"contaminated\" not by medieval commentators or teachers but rather by scholars still alive and working in Erasmus's day, namely Giacomo Filippo Foresti (called Bergomensis, 1434-1520) and Robert d'Evremond (d. 1480). Their annotated texts were substantial folio volumes, aimed at teachers more than students. These editions were only thirty or forty years old when Erasmus sat down at Louvain in 1513 to work on the Cato, and they had been reprinted several times, as recently and as nearby as Antwerp in 1504. The texts Erasmus complains of, then, had not decayed through centuries of classroom misuse, but had been freshly packaged for the press in the 1470's and were still in current use. Their principal fault, as described in the great humanist's preface, was that they overloaded the little sayings of Pseudo-Cato with too many notes useless to schoolboys. Even in the hands of a talented schoolmaster, they could be pernicious in that they would encourage him to displays of erudition, the last thing his students needed. (108) Erasmus's real animus against these authors was that both of them were monks and that their notes loaded up the little Cato, an ancient and pagan text, with anachronistically Christian notions.</p>\n<p>Erasmus turned immediately to the matter of authorship: \"Next, I do not contemplate saying definitively who is the author of this work, or whether there was one author or many. I do think it is ascribed to Cato only because it contains sayings worthy of Cato.\" (109) No matter the uncertainty, for the proper context of the Cato anthology was clear, including other ancient proverbs that Erasmus included in his printed collection. One group, he says, is properly ascribed to Mimus Publianus, even though it had long been falsely entitled \"Proverbs of Seneca\" and contaminated with sayings taken from Seneca and Aulus Gellius. Although the point of the new textbook was to provide a large and varied collection of ancient proverbs for schoolboys, Erasmus insisted on the integrity of the smaller collections within it, this because they had their own philosophical content, identifiable authorship, and linguistic unity. Ancient proverbs could not be properly understood without taking these diverse historical contexts into account. Mixing up Mimus Publianus (of the first century B.C.E.) with Seneca (of a century later) and Gellius (of the second century C.E.) was bad philology, bad history, <em>and</em> bad pedagogy. Only after they had been properly situated philologically could they conduce to the higher, universal wisdom that is true philosophy. (110)</p>\n<p>For Erasmus, even the simple logic of putting together a school book spelled controversy. His preface continued:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But meanwhile some wrangler will call out, \"Why do you, O Theologian, attend to such silly nuggets?\" Well, first of all, I hold nothing onerous, however humble, that pertains to good letters, much less anything that is as useful for the purity of Latin language as it is conducive to good morals. Moreover, why would I be ashamed to pass a few hours on this task, when many Greek writers, and not bad ones either, were praised for their learning in it?

But the irony is magnified for us, in that there was hardly any humanist readier than Erasmus to pick a fight. Indeed, this whole preface was a manifesto for a new way of using the proverb collections traditional in Latin pedagogy. Erasmus did not deny their age-old value in educating school boys to good conduct; he insisted upon that. But he insisted as well that they are good models of Latin. Moreover, he said, it is dishonest to teach these proverbs without a philological context that would allow the boys sooner or later to recognize that the morality of the ancients was historically conditioned and distinct from that of the sixteenth Christian century.

Even the many later editions by other editors, who dispensed with Erasmus's careful packaging, took his textual emendations and paraphrases into account.</p>\n<p>Erasmus advocated a new kind of pedagogy for collections of moral sayings, one that respected their original non-Christian contexts. His work on improving the texts, however, was more enduring than his careful contextualization. The sixteenth century was an age of anthologizing, and the traditional pedagogy of memorization encouraged students at all levels to learn and recycle pithy phrases or commonplace ones without contextualizing them. Indeed, most teachers worked directly against Erasmus' ideal; they presented moral axioms and proverbs as <em>mere</em> commonplaces, universally or specifically applicable as any given thematic need arose in speaking or writing.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(108) Boas 1938, 281-283 and Boas 1940, 64-68; Perraud 1988, 89-91; Thompson and Perraud 1990, 55-58; Henkel 1995, 219-221.

Then they were to parse and drill four sayings from the <em>Mercurius</em> each day in detail for two months. Thereafter they could increase the daily dose to ten sayings so that within a year all 1,141 sayings would have been drilled. In the sample drills, Latin is clearly the target language, but the title page implies that a Latin speaker (perhaps Schoppe envisions a German like himself) could master spoken Italian in the same way. That this was Schoppe's sense of his work is confirmed by the publication within a decade of a <em>Mercurius quadrilinguis</em> which offered the same sayings and proverbs in four-column format, adding Greek and Hebrew equivalents to the Italian ones in the bilingual original. Still, it is hard to say how seriously Schoppe intended his \"Mercuries\" to be used for teaching Italian to foreigners. They appeared mostly on the Italian market and the only modern language to appear was Italian, so the shortcut to languages they offered was almost surely intended for native speakers of Italian studying classical languages.</p>\n<p>Schoppe's parsing examples are instructive of the degree to which even so thoroughly bilingual a system as the one he advocates was based on traditional drills. In the main text of the book each phrase was given a precise Italian equivalent. So, for the very first phrase, <em>In nomine Sanctissimae Trinitatis</em>, the printed text gives <em>in, o nel nome della Santiss. Trinita</em>. The instructions in the front matter told the Latin master to make each student write out the Latin phrase. Then the class together was to drill each word with its Italian equivalent. Related or derivative words were added with their Italian equivalents. So, for <em>nomine</em>, the students were told to recite the nominative Latin, <em>nomen</em> and the Italian <em>nome</em>, and also to recognize the derivative Latin verb and its Italian twin, \"nominare, dar nome.\" Both the noun and verb were to be parsed fully in Latin with vernacular equivalents (\"<em>nomen</em>, a name; <em>nominis</em>, of a name; <em>nomine</em>, by or for a name...\") before the class went on to the next word.</p>\n<p>Schoppe was explicit on the pedagogical psychology of combining such oral drills with writing and on the responsibility of the master to proceed at a rate that the students can follow. The master, moreover, was to furnish his classroom with appropriate tools:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[The teacher] will require his students to write out each of these words and those which have similar meanings in the vernacular, not so they will learn them immediately, but so that they will re-read them several times at home. For it is not easy for them to recall to memory the things that are contained in the sayings if they are merely admonished orally. On this account the master will employ a dictionary in which derivatives are always given together with the roots and compounds, the best being the Greek-Latin Lexicon of Scapula, and for German-Latin Rasyppodius and Basilis Faber. (116)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This advice assumed, perhaps unrealistically, that the Italian schoolmaster would have access to the best recent reference books published abroad, for example, Johannes Scapula's <em>Lexicon</em> <em>Graeco-Latinum recentiss</em>. (published at Geneva in 1593; Basel in 1605, etc.). In fact these books might have been available in Milan, Padua, or Venice in the period, but it is unclear that they could easily be found in more provincial towns; and it is unclear why Italian students would want or need one of the Greek-German dictionaries that Schoppe also recommended. Certainly many a schoolroom did without.</p>\n<p>Schoppe framed his collection of proverbs as the start of a comprehensive beginning language course. He continued a long tradition of seeing moral sayings as well as practical ones as the right vehicle for language acquisition. However, he untied the reading of proverbs from the parallel memorization of grammatical rules that had obtained in medieval and Renaissance Latin classrooms. Schoppe developed a comprehensive, all-purpose phrase book for learning the spoken and written language; it is preceded only by drilling in the noun and verb paradigms. That is, the matter of Cato has been detached entirely from the schoolbook it accompanied for so long, the Donat, and subsumed into a new form entirely, the textbook targeted specifically at the speakers of one (usually modern) language who wish to learn another, ancient or modern one. Schoppe was nothing if not prolific and ambitious. He authored a number of other schoolbooks, including a Latin grammar intended to accompany the* Mercurius bilinguis* and introductory works on rhetoric. He also wrote several works on curriculum which combined remarks on educational psychology, details on the structure of a humanities course, bibliographical essays and recommended-reading lists, and pointed criticism of contemporary schools, especially the Jesuit colleges.

Printed grammars and reading textbooks in particular were the vehicle for widely promoting the ideals of pure classical Latin. Whether we choose to see humanist education as conformist and elitist or as conducing to the ideals the humanists themselves mouthed, that is, austere personal integrity, civic pride, and political engagement, (118) it is clear that humanist teachers went out of their way to market their program effectively to the readers of printed books. Their advertising prose slowly abandoned the pedantically diffuse, courtly, and avuncular formulas of the fifteenth century in favor of a more pointed and ebullient boosterism. But many of the themes remained the same. Latin was the key both to the door of success (to a career in public service, at court, or in the academy) and also to the treasure chest of ancient wisdom, that is, to an understanding of true philosophy. Cicero and a limited number of other writers were to be imitated for their style and expressive power. Above all, students were sold the idea that moral and grammatical correctness were one and the same thing.</p>\n<p>These themes were not new. Some had been inherited directly from medieval pedagogy while others were recast with the urgency of philological classicism. All were grounded in a philologically and morally normative practice of letters that was part of the classical inheritance. (119) The age of Reformation and Counter-Reform worked another, more profound change on the humanist educational and publishing agenda by introducing notions of doctrinal orthodoxy to classrooms at even the most elementary level. It was no longer enough for the student to conform his mind to the general political and spiritual commonplaces of his society or to respect civil and church authorities. In the sectarian Europe of the late sixteenth century, students and teachers had to conform with particular care to the finely pointed orthodoxies of specific institutional churches administered in detail by specialized bureaucrats and magistrates. Printers and publishers had to worry this same punctilious orthodoxy. Elementary textbooks were not exempt from the kind of scrutiny that more ambitious theological and philosophical writings endured. Erasmus, philosopher and ad man, is the most poignant case in point, for his <em>Adagia</em>, his Cato, and many other writings of no theological import were banned by Roman and local church authorities. We will encounter such censors again in later chapters, for their shadows were long and dark.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(118) Contrast Grafton and Jardine 1986 and Black 2007, 466-468 to Garin 1976, 95-108, Grendler 1989, 201-02, 208-211 and Black 2007, 297-306.</li>\n<li>(119) Gehl 2002, 1-3, 15-16; Lerer 2002.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"From 1470 to 1650, Italians absorbed the lessons of humanism with the aid of printing.

The \"method\" consisted of mastering exactly 1,141 short sayings arranged under forty-two broad subject heads. This method was not in fact new, since it had been used extensively in Northern Europe for decades, though it was still relatively untested in Italy at the period. (113) Schoppe begins with catechism rubrics, \"On God and some of his attributes,\" and \"On the passion of Christ.\" These are strictly orthodox in theological content, starting with the Trinity and the Eucharist so as to establish for the Italian market that the work is not in any way Protestant. There follow several other groups suggested by the experience of the Counter-Reformation Church, so: \"On the titles of various ministers of the church and their charges,\" and \"On Scripture, preaching, and penance.\" The anthology then goes on to traditional moral subjects such as \"On obedience and reverence for elders and respect for rulers,\" or \"On preserving love, concord, and a calm demeanor with your neighbor.\" Further along, there are more objective, encyclopedic categories: \"On the liberal arts and sciences,\" \"On medicine and disease,\" and the like. The collection concludes with one hundred witty sayings that can be used to counter detractors or critics.</p>\n<p>This choice of subjects betrays considerable ambition. The sayings were intended to cover a variety of facts, linguistic usages, and rhetorical situations; to inculcate religious and moral concepts; and to drill students in various specialized vocabularies. Many phrases are not proverbs at all, but merely conversational or compositional usages, a fact noted with advertiser's pride on the title pages of some editions: \"This work collects many proverbs, adages and apopthegmata of famous men, as well as many miscellaneous phrases adapted to everyday use.\" (114) Schoppe's preface told the reader that his book contains well chosen vocabulary of three types: <em>quotidiana</em> or everyday words; <em>fundamentalia</em> or root-words from which many derivatives can be learned; and <em>rara</em>, choice and unusual words. The second-category words are particularly important for drilling because they provide the broadest understanding of many cognates. Anthologizing of this wide-ranging sort goes back to medieval practices. In humanist pedagogy it was often presented as a method of learning conversational Latin. The sayings came from many sources but they were not attributed to their authors or contextualized in any way beyond the subject categorization. Schoppe banished Erasmus's insistence on nuanced, historical and philological context from the elementary classroom and replaced it with a rigid Counter-Reformation orthodoxy. (115) He presented the sayings as the raw material for grammatical analysis and composition, much as the Cato had been used in medieval schools.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(113) On the English textbooks for language study which may well have been models for Schoppe, Wyatt 2005, esp. 163-180.

He wished to dedicate to Gorio a small elementary Latin textbook designed for boys like the doctor's own sons. After remarking that he had composed no fewer than fourteen such schoolbooks, all printed in Rome, he put down a list of them and added this wry observation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Truly that is all. No other works of mine interrupt the leisure of the printers. All these books were composed during these last twelve years at night, at the insistence of students, and amidst difficulties and worry about domestic matters, as you well know. For what Eusebius writes of Lactantius is often the case, \"Up to the age of thirty-eight years, he lived partly in his homeland and partly at Rome.\" (1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here, in the context of a classical commonplace -- the careerist away from home lamenting the difficulty of finding time to write -- Mancinelli slips in a minor but very modern complaint. He worked hard and incessantly at his writing but the printers had only to reproduce them, an easy task by contrast to his own.</p>\n<p>Master Antonio Mancinelli was a lay teacher with excellent philological credentials and impeccable moral ones, a combination not always found in late fifteenth-century humanist circles, especially in hedonistic Rome. His life offers a useful case for exploring the impact of print, and the role of printers, in the teaching of elementary subjects because he was so self-conscious a participant. Born in 1452, he undertook a teaching career in just those years in the early fourteen seventies when printing began to take hold in Italy. He matured while Italian humanists were actively engaged in editing the classics for the press and were at the same time debating the role of print in the transmission of classical texts.</p>\n<p>Twenty years later, when Mancinelli had been teaching for some years in Rome, and when his reputation as a grammatical humanist was at its peak, the Italian printing industry was well established. Printed books at all levels of ambition and price were plentiful. In major printing centers, notably Venice and Milan, there was lively competition among printers for the best works of the most successful authors, even in highly traditional fields like grammar. Starting in the 1480's we can observe the phenomenon of best-selling contemporary authors and a perhaps inevitable accompaniment, piracies and unauthorized editions. This competitive climate would deeply affect Mancinelli's reputation and even the survival of some of his works.Â Â  Mancinelli was an active player in the publication of his own works. He often addressed himse</p>\n<p>It may even be that Mancinelli's success as an author of printed textbooks limited the survival of his works in manuscript form. There are few manuscripts of his pedagogical works and the frequently printed ones are particularly rare in manuscript, suggesting two conclusions. First, widespread printing so saturated the market for some schoolbooks that few teachers or students felt the need to copy these short, useful texts by hand. Mancinelli's textbooks could be had easily and inexpensively, especially in Italy, but also in France, Germany, and the Low Countries. Secondly, from mid-career onward, Mancinelli likely sent his works directly to press without ever preparing manuscript copies for classroom use. He truly made the transition from manuscript to print authorship in the course of his thirty-five-year teaching career.</p>\n<p>It was as a teacher that Mancinelli achieved notoriety. Most classroom reputations are modest and do not survive the life span of a \"famous\" teacher's students. This fact of classroom fame was true in most of Western intellectual history before the invention of printing. In ancient times, there is only one example of a grammarian, Aelius Donatus, whose name became a permanent fixture in the classroom literature. Among the many medieval grammatical pedagogues, only Alexander of Villa Dei had this kind of published afterlife. The cult of personality in early humanist circles created at least three more, Gasparino Barzizza and Guarino Veronese in the first generation, and Lorenzo Valla in the next. Valla' case is exceptional because, though he wrote an elementary grammar, it was never much used. His classroom afterlife (as distinct from his larger fame) came about because others digested his scholarly works for the use of students.</p>\n<p>Print publication created a different kind of fame. It gave some fairly ordinary teachers in Mancinelli's generation (and ever since) the opportunity for a permanent, or at least long-term literary reputation specifically as textbook writers. The first grammarian to achieve this distinction in print was Nicolò Perotti, a generation older than Mancinelli, who also penned one of the first critiques of the press as a transmitter of faulty texts. (3) Print also prolonged the useful life of textbooks by Donatus, Alexander, and Guarino, or books attributed to them. Thus, the pedagogical principles and teaching skills of the author of a successful textbook could last for generations. For the first time in history, textbook authors could reasonably hope to turn contemporary fame into a permanent reputation for good teaching practice, perhaps even into economic success in their own lifetimes.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(1) Mancinelli 1490b: <em>Quae quidem omnia.

If we consider his various pedagogical works in the order, not of their composition but of their printing, we will discover the biography (largely an autobiography) of a <em>publishing teacher</em>.</p>\n<p>Mancinelli's interest in grammar started in his hometown of Velletri, south of Rome, where he studied and later taught in the grammar school. In one preface he said that by the time he was 21 he was the head of the school. He described the first twenty years of his career in a brief verse autobiography that he published in 1493. By that time he had taught in Velletri, Sermoneta, Rome, Fano, and Venice. He returned to Velletri in the summer of 1493 to resume teaching there. Most of the autobiographical poem concerns his hometown and its countryside (the beautiful, south-facing slopes of the Alban Hills), his parents, and his own children. But he also refers to the newly elected Borgia Pope, Alexander VI, perhaps in the hope of patronage; and he describes his teaching and lists his publications chronologically. We know from other documents that he taught in Velletri from 1493 to 1498, in Orvieto from 1498 to 1500, and in Rome once more from 1500 forward. (18)</p>\n<p>Apparently Mancinelli early on felt the need for new classroom materials, for he said he devised his <em>Rules for Construction</em> (<em>Regulae constructionis</em>) and <em>Summary of Declensions</em> (<em>Summa declinationis</em>) in his earliest years of teaching. This tells us that in the early 1470's he used them in the classroom in manuscript form before they went to print. But no manuscript copies survive, and the <em>Summa</em> exists in a single copy now in London. The story of these early works is further complicated by their frequent reprinting in revised and enlarged editions. Two of the earliest surviving textbooks by Mancinelli -- the <em>Rules for Verbs</em> (<em>Regimen verborum</em>) and <em>Introduction to Rhetoric</em> (<em>De oratore brachylogia</em>) published in 1477-- are small sets of rules quoted from ancient grammarians and rhetoricians  Mancinelli supposed that such works of extraction and compilation from the ancient writers would have direct use in the classroom.

They claimed Mancinelli's diligence as a corrector for their texts, even after his death.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/3.00_Chapter_Three/Inc.5455,-Carmen-de-floribus-ad-Veliternos,-pg.41v-42r.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/3.00_Chapter_Three/Inc.5455,-Carmen-de-floribus-ad-Veliternos,-pg.41v-42r.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">The reader corrects and adds on (click to enlarge - 648 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>One might expect that the writers of advertisements would gloss over the inherent flaws of the printing process, but exactly the opposite was true. All these writers in Mancinelli's orbit were pretty matter-of-fact about the way in which printing introduced and perpetuated errors. Indeed, they emphasized the bad texts that printing produced. Their very self-consciousness was a vindication of the processes of correction, revision, and enlargement that characterized the creation of successive editions of texts that were -- even in imperfect form -- highly successful. It seems likely that Mancinelli himself prompted this notion of continuous revision as a positive aspect of his works. (14)</p>\n<p>Readers, too, often calmly took the imperfections of printed books in stride. They had, after all, been correcting their manuscript books for centuries; and it was an important part of a humanist education to learn to be critical of received texts, that is, to look for errors to correct. A copy of Mancinelli's <em>Verses on the Figures of Speech</em> (<em>Carmen de figuris</em>) now at the Newberry Library was heavily annotated by a humanist reader. At one point the reader remarked in the narrow bottom margin, \"Two articles, those on Sylepsis and Dialyton, are missing here. For lack of space at this point you will find them transcribed at the beginning of this book. Farewell.\" (15) Turning back to the first page of the treatise, we find these two articles fully transcribed in the ample left margin, and then another note to future readers:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/3.00_Chapter_Three/Inc.5455,-Carmen-de-floribus-ad-Veliternos,-pg.40v-41r.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/3.00_Chapter_Three/Inc.5455,-Carmen-de-floribus-ad-Veliternos,-pg.40v-41r.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Missing text supplied by a reader (click to enlarge - 635 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These two articles were omitted by the printer at the place in order where they belonged, and so I have supplied them from another source.

They were usually reprinted with the original dates in later editions. The prefaces had a dual function. They situated individual works in Mancinelli's network of patronage; and they were meant to stand as samples of humanist letter writing which could be studied and explicated in class like any other specimen of good prose. Mancinelli's early prefaces were addressed to his students or former students, or to their parents. They assume a community of learners centered upon the school of the master. The dedicatees were usually urban professionals, often themselves intellectuals -- canon and civil lawyers, doctors, notaries, and theologians. For the early works, almost all of them were natives of provincial Velletri. This fact of mid-range, local patronage bespeaks the professionalism achieved by humanist teachers in Mancinelli's generation. Mancinelli taught in institutional schools, and never, so far as we know, aspired to serve as tutor to an aristocratic family. Tutoring jobs of the sort were available and highly desired well into the sixteenth century; but it was in Mancinelli's day entirely possible for a humanist to have a teaching career without the benefits or burdens of personal, noble patronage.</p>\n<p>Printing, of course, also played a role in this professionalization of teaching. In a private tutor's classroom there was little need for printed books, even after they were available, since one or two students could manage with a few manuscript copies and might even benefit from the exercise of copying their own texts directly from those owned by the master. By the fourteenth century, the growth of urban schools had created a demand for relatively large numbers of elementary schoolbooks and these were produced to standard patterns by commercial stationers. (20) The application of printing to this production process increased the potential for standardized curricula and for teachers to work with ever larger numbers of students. Almost immediately, it also permitted the quick production and widespread diffusion of entirely new textbooks.</p>\n<p>Mancinelli was well placed to take advantage of this novel publishing opportunity and he even referred to it directly in the first of his surviving prefaces, saying, in effect, that no one has done this task before, and that printing the basic rules on difficult points of grammar is labor-saving for the teacher and beneficial to students in that they can progress more quickly. The advantages Mancinelli cited were specific to the printed book. The teacher no longer had to dictate and correct manuscript textbooks for student use in the classroom. Students could move faster because they did not have to write out their own copies of basic books or correct faulty ones obtained from stationers. (21) Note that speedy learning of this sort is most beneficial to the student who is a quick study. Much medieval and Renaissance basic schooling was aimed at identifying early on which students had the gifts to go on to further study and weeding out the others. Mancinelli elsewhere expressed a later ideal that the moral value of study makes Latin useful even for less gifted students; but he adhered to older pedagogical principles sufficiently to feel that quicker students should be given the (now printed) means to move along at their own pace.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(20) Gehl 1993, 56-70.</li>\n<li>(21) Mancinelli 1477b.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Most of what we know about the circumstances and dates of composition of Mancinelli's works comes from the elegant Ciceronian letters that preface individual works.

What were the <em>Regulae constructionis</em> and <em>Summa declinationis</em> of the mid-1470's, which Mancinelli described as distinct works in his 1477 preface? The first surviving edition of the <em>Regulae</em> is that of 1490, which included the material from the 1477 <em>Regimen</em>. It was printed in such a way as to imply that <em>Regulae</em> and <em>Summa</em> were conceived together and indeed they are treated as a single work in Mancinelli's 1493 autobiography. In 1490, one preface addressed to Battista Gorio (quoted in section 3.01)) stands before the two works, which are also linked on the title page. In effect we have lost the first version of these works entirely, the one that Mancinelli tested in manuscript form in his Velletri classroom and sent to print in Rome about 1475.</p>\n<p>The content of the two treatises probably was roughly similar to that of the later, expanded versions. They treat, respectively, verb and noun inflectional paradigms. The originals may have been somewhat shorter than the earliest surviving versions, which occupy forty and sixteen leaves respectively, since Mancinelli said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This second version of these <em>Epitomata</em> [i.e. the <em>Regulae</em>] and <em>Summa Declinationis</em> is better than the first, for I have added examples of verbs which have difficult participles and supines. Often certain things were changed, for corruption occurs through the carelessness of the printers, as can be seen here and there in various places. Many things defended by the authority of the ancients in that edition are explained more briefly here. (22)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, Mancinelli was matter-of-fact about the need for corrections to printed texts. He repeatedly tinkered with his textbooks to make them more useful in class. And useful they continued to be; there are recorded editions as late as 1563. (23)</p>\n<p>The next prefaces date from 1487 and 1488 (though they survive only in editions from 1491 and later) and concern works of an even more elementary character than the <em>Regulae</em> and <em>Summa</em>. The <em>Donatus melior</em> (<em>Better Donat</em>, or <em>Improved Donat</em> if you will), was Mancinelli's title for an anthology that he proposed as a universal first Latin textbook. It includes three short works, two of them so traditional in Italian classrooms that the practical Mancinelli knew they could not be supplanted. The anthology begins with the elementary rulebook ascribed to Donatus (the <em>Ianua</em> or Donat) emended by Mancinelli. There follow the <em>Distichs of Cato</em>, similarly corrected and provided with a short commentary by Mancinelli on the first sixteen proverbs. Finally, the <em>Better Donat</em> includes Mancinelli's own versified set of elementary grammatical rules for memorization, called <em>Little Book on Grammar</em> (<em>De arte libellus</em>). The earliest surviving edition already claimed to be a second edition with additions. (24)</p>\n<p>Mancinelli, like most pedagogues of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, used \"Donatus\" in two ways. The term referred specifically to the text of the rulebook ascribed to Donatus, and also to the physical grammar book, in this case the group of texts that make up the <em>Better Donat</em>. As usual, Mancinelli's preface is enlightening:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DONATVS MELIOR. Â¶ Antonio Mancinelli of Velletri to his dear sons Pindar, Quintus, and Festus. Greetings. I have decided to polish up for you the little book of Donatus on grammar, put out in the past disfigured in many places by the carelessness of scribes. For it is difficult to change habits of mind once they are established. ... It was hardly less troublesome to correct the little book of Cato, rich in wisdom and wise sayings but almost everywhere corrupt. ... After you have studied this Donat well, and once you memorize the summary of declensions and the booklet on constructions, which were published two years ago, you will easily understand the basics of all Grammar. (25)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The teacherly father emerges clearly here. The Latin master uses a strictly classical form to address his sons, whom he had named for Roman martyrs and classical figures.</p>\n<p>More importantly for our purposes in studying educational publishing, Mancinelli clearly ascribed the poor state of the text of <em>Ianua</em> and the <em>Distichs of Cato</em> to the long tradition of scribal copies. Teachers in the past had been content with the poor text because they themselves learned from such defective copies, memorizing even the errors. Mancinelli's claim is demonstrably true in that many surviving manuscripts and early editons contain egregious errors of sense. The modern editor of the <em>Distichs</em>, Marcus Boas, points out how early and persistent these errors could be. (26) So Mancinelli did not merely parrot a humanist commonplace. His claim was phrased to frame a printed textbook. In the <em>Better Donat</em>, his labor of correcting will have a better chance to survive into many copies.</p>\n<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, Mancinelli's improved text met with some resistance. The earliest surviving edition already included an afterward labeled \"Mancinelli to the Reader,\" which is an apology for revisions he has made. It is an impassioned complaint against those teachers who criticized his textbook out of ignorance. Mancinelli ascribed their critique first to malice and secondly to their having been ill trained in their own childhoods, meaning that they had learned from a faulty text of the Donat and so would not accept his corrections to it. The remainder of the afterward is a list of authorities for a few changes he has made, clearly in response to specific complaints. He replied at length, for example, to the \"wicked men\" who criticized his phrasing of the rules for future imperatives. He also vindicated his favoring one ancient grammarian over another on the correct second person present indicative of <em>fero</em>, which is <em>ferris</em> and not <em>fereris</em>. These points may seem rather minor; but Mancinelli's highly colored rhetoric makes clear that such details represented more than the specifics at issue. The \"wicked men\" who complained about changing the traditional Donat stand in for all those who accepted unclassical Latin uncritically and even vaunted their ignorance of humanist Latin. (27) That this was not a one-time battle for Mancinelli and other humanist pedagogues can be deduced from the fact that this afterward to the reader was included in every subsequent edition of the <em>Better Donat</em> for fifty years and more. Publishers were also quick to claim to be using Mancinelli's improved texts. In Northern Europe, Mancinelli's much-improved Cato text and commentary had considerable success, especially when the Paris printer Josse Bade Ascensius promoted it.

Textbook prefaces like Mancinelli's were almost universally modeled on the familiar letters of Cicero, which were entirely adequate to such pedagogical commonplaces as patron/client relations, discipleship, the moral value of elementary education, and affection between teacher and student. Cicero, however, offered no models for discussing mechanical text production. There was little else in ancient literature to suggest that authors should address the mundane facts of publication. Mancinelli's contemporary Agnolo Poliziano (1454-1494) imitated Martial when describing copies of his works corrected by the author in contrast to uncorrected ones. But Martial wrote about fans who demanded personal, autograph copies, not stationer's products, so Poliziano's citation was a deliberate anachronism rather than a thoughtful address to printing. (4) Similarly, humanists sometimes moralized correct texts. They used martial, judicial, and above all Christian confessional terms to present printed texts personally, as if both texts and authors were in need of moral self-correction. (5)</p>\n<p>On the other hand, humanists often feigned surprise at the effects printing had on their works or reputation. (6) The French grammarian Jean Pellisson (ca. 1500-1557), for example, treated publication as a mildly unpleasant and sometimes burdensome by-product of composition. In the 1529 preface he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Seven years ago or so, I allowed some <em>Progymnasmata on Grammar</em> to be published under my name, something I now wholly regret and acknowledge I did wrongly because I did not assemble very much material in that volume. ... But when I finally saw these books widely distributed daily, with copies printed many times at Lyon, and later at Poitiers and Rouen, and when the printers of Paris were again making preparations to publish the work, I revised it wholly without delay. ... This I did willingly, for even at the schools of Paris (which own a reputation of authority throughout the world for teaching and forming youths in good letters) one is wary of that ubiquitous carelessness into which I had unwisely fallen in publishing those <em>Progymnasmata</em>. (7)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, if Pellisson had really been embarrassed about the imperfections of his work, he would hardly have included the fact of its frequent publication in the preface to the revised edition. His remarks, however, do imply that he felt it was necessary to differentiate the fame that followed publication from the true worth of his teaching. (8)</p>\n<p>We will return in a later chapter (see section 4.09) to the marketing strategy embodied in such claims. For the present, Pellisson's fussiness need concern us only by contrast to Antonio Mancinelli's straightforward addresses to the vicissitudes of publication, including the potential circulation of highly imperfect texts. Only a few years separate Mancinelli's last works from Pellisson's first ones, but Mancinelli, in the first generation of teachers to know print, had already accepted the instability of the printed text and the concomitant need to revise and correct constantly. His insistence on this point is explicit, and it impressed itself on his students, admirers, and even his imperfect printers. Consider the preface to a second edition of his <em>Better Donat</em>: \"Concerning an earlier edition of the <em>Better Donat</em>: Certain printers had corrupted the text, as happens. And so, when they finally decided to go to print again, whatever was damaged by them seemed to be about to be corrected.\" (9)</p>\n<p>We might contrast this easy-going optimism with the prose of some of his publishers, who insisted strenuously on the correctness of their texts. Mancinelli's Roman printer Euchario Silber severely criticized Venetian editions by Giovanni Tacuino as totally unreliable. (10) Subsequently Tacuino insisted that Mancinelli himself had corrected the texts for new reprints shortly before he died. Upon examination, however, Tacuino's claim proves to have been copied in part from one by Pietro Martire Mantegazza who had reprinted some of the same works in Milan in the previous year, saying Mancinelli was present during the printing. There is no way of verifying either claim. (11)</p>\n<p>Josse Bade Ascensius took up Mancinelli's texts again. Most of his prefaces simply repeat the Mantegazza/Tacuino statement that the work was corrected by Mancinelli's own hand shortly before his death. In one case, however, Bade made a more specific advertising claim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In recent days, I have reread the several small works on Latin language by Antonio Mancinelli, whether collected by him or corrected. There I noted some few things that it seemed should be marked with asterisks and fewer still with daggers. The passages that seemed obscure are marked with asterisks or stars; with daggers or darts are labeled those which, either through the carelessness of the printer or his own haste, seemed corrupt; and things to be cancelled are indicated with a sideways stroke of the pen as with the darts. (12)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bade implied, then, that he had access to autograph corrections by Mancinelli, which he intended to take into account in his own revision of the text. This kind of remark was also a commonplace in humanist descriptions of problematic manuscripts. (13) We need not doubt the truth of Bade's account, but we should also recognize it for the advertisement it was.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(4)Â  Dane 1999, 20-22; further on Poliziano's ambiguous attitude toward publication, Godman 1998, 90-96.</li>\n<li>(5)Â  Lerer 2002, 24-41; West 2006, 253-261.</li>\n<li>(6)Â  Richardson 1999, 82-83.</li>\n<li>(7) Translated from Pellisson 1562 and 1566: <em>Nam quae Progymnasmata in grammaticen, ante septem plus minus annos, nomine meo sum passus edi, horum omnino me quidem poenitet, et peccasse fateor, qui tam multa non in loco congesterim....

The commentary on Virgil poses an important question: Why make another printed commentary on Virgil, especially in light of the new and popular commentary of Cristoforo Landino? There were, after all, no fewer than sixteen editions of Virgil with commentary available to Italian scholars at the date of writing in late 1490. Three more would appear before Mancinelli's edition got through the press in December 1491. Mancinelli's answer was to insist on the stubborn ignorance of his critics. He mentioned the eminent Landino (1424-1492) in passing; but he claimed that the real problem lay in the long-studied commentary of Servius (4th century), because scholars followed it blindly and uncritically. Mancinelli's version is a labor on behalf of his students who will read Virgil more easily with this commentary than with the others. His contributions, beyond careful copy editing of the received texts, were limited to grammatical comments on the <em>Georgics</em> and <em>Bucolics</em>, prefaces to each poem or book, and mnemonic-verse arguments. (36) Mancinelli's success may be judged by the fact that his notes were included in most editions of Virgil for the next forty years.</p>\n<p>Mancinelli's commentary on the <em>Satires</em> of Juvenal is a more thoroughgoing work. Although it is respectful of existing commentaries, just as the work on Virgil was, it represents a comprehensive approach to Juvenal as a school author. It appeared in December 1492, with a dedicatory letter dated June 1492, the first work of Mancinelli to issue from the Venetian press of Giovanni Tacuino, who would have a major role in the popularization of Mancinelli's works. It is a folio-sized volume with an elaborate apparatus. Mancinelli began the work at Rome (where Juvenal had been an important subject of discussion at the university) but its writing no doubt occupied a large part of the academic year 1491-92, when Mancinelli was teaching in Fano.</p>\n<p>Successful commentaries on Juvenal by Domizio Calderini (1446-1478) and Giorgio Valla (1447-1500) had been circulating for some years in Italy before Mancinelli set to work, exactly the situation of his Virgil edition and commentary. (37) Juvenal was commonly taught in humanist schools; and commented editions were of use to teachers in preparing their lectures. Mancinelli explicitly advertised the usefulness of his commentary in his letter dedicating it to his Venetian patron, Niccolò Rossi. He named four commentaries already available in print and said he will add a fifth because no matter how many learned things his predecessors had remarked, they nonetheless omitted many things which would be useful for adolescent students. Mancinelli's was to be a comprehensive commentary, since he had \"left nothing unconsidered, nothing implied, nothing unresolved.\" (38)</p>\n<p>Furthermore, since he had emended the text extensively to rid it of errors introduced by scribes and printers, Mancinelli said he would print his own remarks first in the commentary and follow them with the comments of Calderini and Valla, many of which referred to a corrupt text and so should not be read first. He followed his letter to Rossi with a further series of introductory notes, among them a complete list of the passages he has remarked that were also treated by earlier commentators, so that scholarly readers can turn first to those passages and see the justification for his philological work. This is a curious sort of advertisement, since it is hard to imagine anyone actually doing such laborious cross-checking unless they already knew the Satires by heart and could go quickly to passages they already knew well. The portion of Mancinelli's target audience composed of grammar masters, however, would indeed know the text in this way; or at any rate Mancinelli thought they <em>should</em> be this familiar with Juvenal. Inviting them to inspect his work this closely was an advertisement to specialists.</p>\n<p>Mancinelli also reprinted in full the introductory matter from Calderini's and Valla's commentaries. The commentary on each individual poem followed a standard form, including a prose argument and then detailed glosses with marginal notes to identify the contributions of the three commentators. There were also marginal index notes, but these cover only the notabilia in Mancinelli's commentary and not those of Valla or Calderini, another device to emphasize the new content of this volume. In a flourish typical of Mancinelli the school versifier, he also provided on the title page a 16-line poem, \"Arguments of Juvenal's Satires by Antonio Mancinelli.\" This bit of verse allowed students to memorize a table of contents, checking off each of the sixteen satires and their basic themes, the better to cite them in future.</p>\n<p>Mancinelli's commentary on Horace also appeared in Venice in 1492. It was more ambitious than the Virgil commentary and better integrated than the Juvenal edition because it incorporated only one previous commentary. It was a major scholarly achievement, expressly intended to counteract the risky Epicureanism of Cristoforo Landino's commentary of 1482. Like Landino, Mancinelli placed the poetry of Horace in a carefully constructed historical context, but he did so by circumscribing the hedonism of Horace (and Landino) with a more attractive Stoicism. Mancinelli no doubt avoided endorsing Horace's Epicureanism because he intended his work for classrooms teachers. This personal conviction may also have seemed prudent in light of the close supervision of humanists in Rome by curial officials.

It is the small, classroom-oriented <em>Versilogus</em>, dated 1488 both in its preface and in the first, Roman edition. This would put its completion some two years after his arrival in Rome and well before the completion of his scholarly work on Horace, Juvenal, and Virgil. A later publisher's advertisement accurately calls it a book of rules for almost every kind of poem. (40) The text has two parts. The first consists of scansion rules for words, with details on syllable length for first, middle and last syllables. There follow brief treatments of the most common verse forms. Teaching texts of the sort were devised throughout the later Middle Ages; they provided reference guides for consultation in future, but their first goal was to help students recognize meters as they read and parsed poetry.</p>\n<p>In these same years, Mancinelli's publishing career took a decisive turn. After a clearly local, Roman start, many of his mid- and late-career works were printed first in the northern centers of Venice and Milan. Most of his teaching career was nearer the presses of Rome, so he might have been expected to want to publish there, especially in view of his apparent wish to correct his works in press. Certainly the burst of activity in printing his work in the North during the fourteen nineties can be explained by the fact that he lived outside Rome for much of that decade. From 1491 to 1493 he taught in Fano and Venice and may have visited Lombardy. This brief period of residence and the concomitant surge of publishing seems to have established his reputation in the North, and his works remained in print there for most of the next fifty years. Some of the work printed there never got Roman editions at all. When he returned to Central Italy to teach (at Velletri, Orvieto and Rome), he had the luxury afforded by his reputation of being able to get his work printed in several places at once. Several plague years in the fourteen nineties required closing the schools and so afforded him additional time to write and edit.</p>\n<p>The nature of the printing industry in Rome was also surely part of the reason why relatively few editions of Mancinelli's later books were printed there. By far the largest part of Roman printing between 1469 and 1490, Mancinelli's own maturing years, consisted of substantial, advanced-level patristic and classical works. Most of these books were directly subsidized by ecclesiastical patrons and much other printing was done for the institutional Church. As a result, none of the presses of Rome in this period was commercial in the sense of depending on competitively produced books. Small textbooks like those Mancinelli was writing were speculative ventures and these were a very minor part of the production of Roman presses by contrast to other major printing centers of Italy. Venice increasingly dominated commercial book publishing in the peninsula in the late fourteen seventies and eighties.</p>\n<p>Mancinelli's realization of these facts of the printing industry may even have contributed to his decision to leave Rome in 1491. He tells us explicitly that he was urged to go to Venice by Pomponio Leto, whose greatest success as a teacher had been in Venice. (41) Leto had had more than his share of troubles in Rome, brought on by his combative personality and his non-conformism (both philosophically and sexually). None of these problems ever beset Mancinelli. We may suspect, therefore, that it was Leto's positive teaching experience and his favorable opinion of the Venetian press that influenced Mancinelli. This supposition is made the more convincing by the fact that Mancinelli worked directly with two Venetian printers with whom Leto also collaborated, Cristoforo Pensi and Filippo Pincio. Giovanni Tacuino, another of Leto's printers, would later play a key role in Mancinelli's career in print. We know that Leto interested himself in matters of type and format during some twenty years' experience with printers. He may have been Mancinelli's model for taking an active part in the presswork. (42)</p>\n<p>As for Mancinelli's expressed interest in correcting his work, the evidence we have on this point is clearest for the last part of his career, from about 1500 onward. It seems to characterize the older and wiser Mancinelli. In those later years, he or his printers and patrons made repeated attempts collect or reprint his works. Mancinelli was concerned to take the opportunity reprinting provided to correct his textbooks and sometimes to expand them. Earlier, however, when individual works were being issued, he was less experienced with printers and perhaps less worried about the accuracy of their work. In the 1490 revised version of the <em>Regulae</em> and <em>Summa</em>, as we have seen, he remarked very much in passing the need for correcting the earlier printed texts. Thereafter neither he nor the printers make explicit mention of the problem until 1500, upon his return to teaching in the Roman university. The context in 1500 and afterward is clearly competitive, filled with claims that Mancinelli's new texts were better than those already on the market. Mancinelli was made in this sense to compete with himself, since the new editions claimed not only to be the best textbooks of many available but also to be better than earlier editions of the same texts.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(40) Mancinelli 1499.</li>\n<li>(41) Mancinelli 1498c, fol.

From the time he left Rome in 1491 onward, the publication of his works becomes so frequent that we must really conceive of his life as a publishing career rather than a teaching one. An early example of how this is so is that the <em>Spica</em> and the <em>Versilogus</em>, originally printed in Rome in combination with other works, were published together in Venice in 1492 and remain paired in many later editions of Mancinelli's works. The value of the combination is not obvious at first, for <em>Spica</em> is a set of verse rules for the noun and verb inflectional paradigms, while the <em>Versilogus</em> contains rules for poetry. The logic of the combination must be sought in the market for textbooks. Both subjects were taught at about the same point in the organized curriculum, shortly after the most elementary presentations of Latin grammar in the Donatus and its accompanying reading texts. So, just about the time the students were ready for a second textbook, they would need both a text for drilling inflections and one to introduce the study of verse forms. \"<em>Spica &#x26; Versilogus</em>,\" as it came to be marketed, was just the ticket. (43)</p>\n<p>While in Venice Mancinelli wrote his most ambitious and influential technical works, namely, a set of notes on Lorenzo Valla's <em>Elegantiae linguae latinae</em>, a digest of that work, and a commentary on the <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em>. These three works were published together as a small manual of philology and rhetoric in the spring of 1494 and had a considerable reputation in this form. They are fully scholarly works, but Mancinelli included them in lists of his schoolbooks, and indeed they had the function of making simpler two classic texts on Latin grammar and rhetoric, one a humanist masterpiece, the other a late Roman one. He probably had Latin students at a fairly advanced level in mind, though surely also with an eye to his growing reputation as a scholar. (44) Both Valla' s works and the <em>Ad Herennium</em> were at the center of a controversy over Ciceronianism at Venice at this date. (45) The <em>Ad Herennium</em> commentary never became a standard; but the Valla commentary was later included in large, scholarly editions of the base text, Valla's <em>Elegantiae</em>, together with commentaries by other humanists.</p>\n<p>All three of these \"Venetian\" works have rather defensive trappings in the form they have come down to us, and we may wonder if this does not reflect the highly competitive world of Venetian publishing. The commentary on the <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em> is prefaced by the longest of Mancinelli's dedication letters. The letter, named separately on the title page, defends the <em>Ad Herennium</em> as a genuine work of Cicero's, a matter that was very much on the mind of Venetian humanists in the period and continued to be debated for some years into the sixteenth century. (46) The two guides to Valla, entitled <em>Epitome Elegantiorum</em> and <em>Lima in Vallam</em>, have prefaces that are even more defensive, probably based on the hard experience of their publishing.</p>\n<p>The <em>Lima</em> (the title means \"polishing file\") is a set of notes correcting and expanding specific points in Valla's <em>Elegantiae</em>. (47) It first appeared in the form of an addendum to the full-dress edition of Valla published by Filippo Pincio, the printer of the Venetian reprint Pomponio Leto's successful edition of Sallust. (48) By mid-March of 1493, Mancinelli had completed the second work, the <em>Epitome</em>, and in the spring of the following year these two works appeared together with the <em>Ad Herennium</em> commentary (completed in November 1493) in a small, separate volume. This April 1494 printing is the first edition of the <em>Epitome</em> and the Cicero commentary but it is described as the \"second edition\" of the <em>Lima</em>, because that work had first appeared in the Valla edition.</p>\n<p>In the preface to the <em>Epitome</em>, Mancinelli responded to criticisms of his daring to correct the great Valla. He did not address a specific patron but entitled his preface \"Antonio Mancinelli to the sons of his friends,\" a strategy that claimed a circle of students and friends but did not risk attaching the anticipated criticisms of the work to any one dedicatee. As a reply to criticism, moreover, the preface was remarkably unsubstantial. Its rhetorical strategy was the most extreme form of one that Mancinelli used elsewhere. He asked a challenging question, why correct Valla, answered it in part, but then shifted the argument to a different plane altogether, justifying his text in terms of the hard work and good intentions that went into it. This was not just bad logic; it was a deliberate strategy of deflection. Unlike the Donatus and Virgil prefaces, which described critics made stubborn by their own uncritical educations, or which refuted critics point by point, Mancinelli simply deflected criticism of his work on Valla by defending his motives in recasting Valla for a different audience. (49)</p>\n<p>The second edition of the <em>Lima</em> also has no personal dedication, a striking fact, because these two works on Valla are almost alone of Mancinelli's works in appearing without dedications to patrons or friends. Under the simple rubric, \"Antonio Mancinelli to the Reader,\" he invoked Valla's own method of studying ancient sources to determine correct grammatical practice. Mancinelli borrowed the title and fame of Valla's work but claimed that it can be made more useful with additions and corrections. Mancinelli wanted to be what one later commentator called him, a Latin <em>observator</em>, that is, a lexicographer who, like Valla, worked by selecting vocabulary from the best ancient authors. Valla, Mancinelli added, wrote about good usage and not about abuses, and sometimes Valla himself added something when he discovered new data. Apparently some of Valla's defenders had complained that when Mancinelli adduced additional passages to some of Valla's points he was implying that Valla had not read the works in question. There are traces of this critique within the commentary too. Mancinelli's sin, it seems, was that he would stack up his own reading list against Valla's. (50)</p>\n<p>An additional clue to Mancinelli's state of mind in his final months of teaching in Venice comes from another volume printed by Filippo Pincio in April 1493. The title page announced two works, the <em>Orthography</em> of Giovanni Tortelli, and a <em>Lima</em> on Tortelli by Antonio Mancinelli. (51) The editor, Pirro Pincio (otherwise unknown, perhaps the printer's brother), mentioned in his preface that he consulted with Mancinelli. Pincio praised Mancinelli's erudition in all matters of Latin philology, remarking especially his commentaries on Virgil and Juvenal. Given the title page and this preface, we would expect the main text to be followed by a set of corrections and additions to Tortelli's work, especially since the orthography of Tortelli was a frequently commented and sometimes problematic text. (52) But strangely, in the place where one would expect Mancinelli's contribution, there is a different, older work on orthography by Giorgio Valla. On the verso of an otherwise blank leaf at the back of the book -- in effect, the back cover -- we find a remarkable printer's note, which only partly explains the curious make-up of the book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although on the front page of this work there is the title of a Lima by Antonio Mancinelli (which there was no chance to remove because we were already printing), we have omitted that work and in its place have printed the tract on orthography by Giorgio Valla. (53)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While Mancinelli's <em>Epitome</em> of Lorenzo Valla was in preparation, then, and just a month or so after his controversial <em>Lima in Vallam</em> had appeared (and while a second printing of his Virgil commentary was also in press), the decision was made not to print a second <em>lima</em> on another widely esteemed contemporary grammarian. In fact, no set of corrections to Tortelli by Mancinelli ever appeared. We cannot know the motives of the author or printer, but the fates of the two <em>limae</em> were surely linked. Toward the end of his stay in Venice, Mancinelli must have been over-busy or feeling embattled or both.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(43) There are editions of the paired works as late as 1527.

The verse autobiography lists them as <em>Spica: figurae: Thesaurus: flores</em>. The order is presumably determined by the meter, since the Verses on Figures of Speech (<em>Carmen de figuris</em>) and the <em>Verses on Ornament</em> (<em>Carmen de floribus</em>) were in fact companion pieces from their first publication. Like the <em>Spica</em> (this poetic title means \"an ear of corn\"), the two <em>carmina</em> are versifications of grammatical rules intended for memorization. They aimed to help the students to recall obscure and difficult points of grammar. The <em>Spica</em> recapitulated in verse much of the irregular noun and verb lore presented in prose in the <em>Regulae</em> and <em>Summa declinationis</em>; the <em>Carmen de figuris</em> rehearsed over one hundred figures of speech; and the <em>Carmen de floribus</em> was an elaborate versified vocabulary. The <em>Dictionary of Verb Usage</em> (<em>Thesaurus de varia constructione</em>) gives a classified list of usages drawn from classical sources worthy of imitation in alphabetical order. Each article gives the verb, its \"constructions\" (the cases or prepositional forms which complete the verb phrase), and an example from a good classical author, cited explicitly. Unlike the other works in this group, it is not in verse. (29)</p>\n<p>Mancinelli said that these four works were written at Velletri, but they were printed only after his move to Rome in 1486. Their dedications reflect Mancinelli's suddenly enlarged and newly clerical acquaintance and the fact that at Rome his appointment was at the University level while he continued to teach younger students privately. Three of them were dedicated to prominent Roman churchmen and their kin. Only the <em>Thesaurus</em> claimed the patronage typical of earlier works, of a lay notable (a university professor) and his sons. (30)</p>\n<p>It would seem, then, that though Mancinelli placed these works in his Velletri period, they were also, at least in part, contributions to a campaign to get hired in Rome or to get recognition there once hired. Up to 1486, after all, Mancinelli had a purely regional reputation and had published only a few things, mostly in Rome. Mancinelli's earliest works were slight, auxiliary texts for grammar teaching at a fairly elementary level. These new works aimed higher, as their dedications imply. The <em>Spica</em> was also prefaced by a bald advertisement: \"Let barbarous Alexander begone, and retreat with his barbarities to his barbarous homeland. Let the truly Roman and elegant Mancinelli everywhere flourish, and everywhere be recited.\" (31) This is a striking claim, that the <em>Spica</em> would supplant the perennially popular <em>Doctrinale</em> of Alexander of Villa Dei, a work that had been used all over Europe for two centuries. Italian humanists had criticized the <em>Doctrinale</em> ineffectually for generations for its unclassical Latinity. Unlike the common Donat, it could not be \"fixed\" by good editing. (32) The pedagogy of the elementary and intermediate Latin course was tied to making students parrot verse rules; so none of the earlier humanist grammars, all in prose, offered an adequate substitute for the <em>Doctrinale</em>. A verse grammar attempted by Lorenzo Valla never even got printed. (33) A systematic treatment in verse of the basic noun and verb inflections was a desideratum, and the <em>Spica</em> was Mancinelli's offering. In the event it had modest success, but never really became a standard textbook.</p>\n<p>Rome also affected the kind of new writing and publishing Mancinelli undertook. As we have seen, the first of his works printed there after his transfer were school texts which he had perhaps been composing in Velletri. But while in Rome, he began work on scholarly commentaries (on Virgil, Juvenal, Horace and Pseudo-Cicero) based on his university teaching. He also composed another school text, called <em>Versilogus</em> (<em>Verse-Form Guide</em>). Part of the logic of this change of emphasis is explained in a letter of spring 1500, where, amidst contract negotiations with the city fathers of Foligno he said that he might be able to take up their offer of a teaching position, but could not do so until the end of September because he wanted to be in Rome that month studying manuscripts of classical authors. (34) One of the attractions of Rome for any humanist was the riches of its libraries, just as one of the costs of accepting provincial appointments was the relative paucity of scholarly resources. Since the indications we have about the dates and places of composition of his early works come from the autobiographical poem that he wrote on his fortieth birthday, it may also be that Mancinelli wanted to present his Roman and Venetian years (1486-1493) as those of maturing scholarly accomplishment, and not just a continuation of his successful teaching career.

The commentary on the <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em> is unremarkable in form. It proceeds by lemmata, short phrases from the base text, like most commentaries derived from classroom teaching (and like Mancinelli's Horace and Virgil commentaries). As such it takes the base text as authoritative with no attempt to argue with the author. Corrections are offered to the received manuscript tradition but not to the authoritative doctrine. Mancinelli, after all, supposed that this was a genuine work of Cicero that embodied the very Latin it was the aim of the humanists to recreate.</p>\n<p>The two works intended to make Valla's lengthy <em>Elegantiae Linguae Latinae</em> useful in the classroom are quite different from the Cicero. It was not entirely original for Mancinelli to attempt to make the unwieldy <em>Elegantiae</em> more approachable by intermediate students of Latin. Indeed, epitomes and compendia of large works were common in all fields of knowledge in the late fifteenth century, made popular by the potential of printing to put copies into many hands. In the earliest years of Italian printing Bonus Accursius created a <em>Compendium</em> of Valla's teaching, roughly following the order of the <em>Elegantiae</em> but organizing the material more systematically, in the manner of a comprehensive introductory grammar. A similar approach was taken by Aurelio Bienato (d.1496), who had known Valla at Naples, and who dedicated his <em>Epithoma</em> to a young student of his own. (54) Mancinelli's approach was more radical. He set our to digest what is useful from Valla in a completely different format. The material that Valla presented by grammatical subject Mancinelli rearranged into short alphabetical entries, in a sort of authorized vocabulary. Completely rearranging the material in this way implied to Mancinelli's students that Valla's observations were of enduring value, but that they needed repackaging to be useful as a classroom tool.</p>\n<p>When Erasmus published his own <em>Epitome</em> of Valla's <em>Elegantiae</em> he criticized Mancinelli's approach. Erasmus found the compilation of alphabetical vocabularies for single authors like Valla ridiculous, and he mocked the apparent visual order of dictionary-style printing. He preferred to present his own <em>Epitome</em> as merely a simplification of Valla's rich treasury, giving the substance of Valla's arguments with fewer examples and less detail. (55)</p>\n<p>In fact, there are many difficulties with using Mancinelli's <em>Epitome</em>. To take an example Erasmus specifically mentioned, Mancinelli gave a substantial article for the conjunction <em>ut</em>, but no discussion at all for its near synonyms. Valla's careful distinctions between similar words get lost entirely. Elsewhere, Mancinelli cross-referenced from the <em>Epitome</em> to the <em>Lima</em>, but since this latter work is <em>not</em> alphabetical, the reader must search out the reference using the printed indexing notes in the margins. Mancinelli clearly intended these marginal notes to be there, but not all readers used them and some later printers omitted them so that the cross-references in the <em>Epitome</em> turned out to be useless.</p>\n<p>In the <em>Lima in Vallam</em> Mancinelli transformed the base text even more, as its audacious title tells us he will have done. A <em>lima</em> is a polishing file, and the phrase <em>in Vallam</em> means that the polishing is \"of Valla,\" but also that the commentator's refinements will be worked \"on Valla\" or even \"against\" him. The format in the printed editions is clear evidence that Mancinelli was intent on improving Valla's text. Mancinelli remarked only a few passages in each of the six books of the <em>Elegantiae</em>, proceeding in order as any commentary would. Recognizing that there were already in 1491 many editions of Valla available, Mancinelli cited the source text not by page but with Valla's first name, \"Laurentius,\" followed by a book and chapter number, all abbreviated and centered on a single line, for example, <em>Lau.lib.vi.c.i.</em> (\"Laurentius,</p>\n<p>What is striking about this arrangement is that, although it preserved the notion of a commentary on an authoritative text by following Valla's order, it also privileged Mancinelli's independent work by giving his remarks their own, consecutive numbering. Valla's text, then, has authority by reason of his reputation for learning. Mancinelli's thoughts on Valla have an exactly parallel authority. Reflecting on a contemporary work of scholarship, Mancinelli says, is equally original scholarship. The <em>Elegantiae</em> were treated as requiring commentary not because the work was difficult or classical, but just because, as a printed text, it was so widespread and so frequently accepted uncritically that it needed polishing up and refining in the light of fifty years of additional humanist philology. Mancinelli's preface, then, was not only an observation on the state of the field, it also made two other claims, that he had mastered matters of Latinity that escaped even the great Valla, and that the text of Valla to be found in printed editions was incomplete, maybe even corrupt.</p>\n<p>Perhaps to reinforce this latter point, Mancinelli followed a numbering of Valla's text that was typical of early Roman and Milanese editions of the <em>Elegantiae</em> but not of the more recent and more numerous Venetian ones. Starting in 1476, Venetian editors typically numbered Valla's chapters with consecutive numbers through all six books. Mancinelli followed the practice of the first Roman edition (and several others) in numbering the chapters anew from the start of each book. (56)</p>\n<p>The handsome format of the <em>Lima</em> emphasized Mancinelli's authority. It is also rather prodigal of space because it uses a full line for the heading of each brief chapter, typically six or eight per quarto page. Whether this format, reminiscent as it is of manuscript practice, was Mancinelli's idea or the printer's we cannot tell, but it is interesting that it persists into successive editions despite the fact that it is relatively wasteful. In 1500 and again in 1503, Bartolomeo Zani published a new edition of Valla and added the <em>Lima</em> as an appendix. He transferred to the folio page the same spacious headings found in the early quarto editions, with the result that the brief <em>Lima</em> occupied fully sixteen folio pages. (57) In 1519 Rusconi would print the <em>Lima</em> in quarto, returning to the original spacious system of centered chapter heads.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(54) On Accursius, Scholderer 1927, 364-267; for Bienato, DBI 10, 269-370.

It begins with a selection of their praises of poetry as a morally uplifting genre. It first appeared in print in Venice in late 1493 with the <em>Carmen de figuris</em> and <em>Carmen de floribus</em>, and in 1495 it was printed as a separate in Rome.

This is a brief, systematic treatment of rhetoric, starting with nine short chapters on letter writing, continuing with a discussion of public speaking in seven chapters, followed by three chapters on education in general. A final chapter, really an appendix, offered vocabulary useful for speaking and writing, in the form of an anthology of vocabulary distinctions (<em>differentiae</em>). In Mancinelli's mind the <em>Scribendi orandique</em> replaced the briefer compositional rhetoric he had composed in the 1470's called <em>De oratore brachylogia</em>, the contents of which are recapitulated in the chapters here on letter writing. Mancinelli, then, followed a pattern we have observed on other occasions. He revised and expanded works first published in brief form, or he returned to a subject from another point of view (or in verse instead of prose), or he created an additional anthology of texts on a given subject from ancient authorities. In the case of the *Scribendi orandique *<em>modus</em>, he actually did all three of these things.

A second Venetian edition followed, probably in 1494, and others appeared between 1496 and 1500. At least five different Venetian printers published this work within a decade of its appearance. All this activity suggests lively interest on the Venetian market for works by the Roman humanist.

The printer Simon Bevilacqua had not worked with Mancinelli before, though he later printed other work from the humanist's pen. Most of Mancinelli's early works appeared with multiple titles on the title page, and often with a brief advertisement composed by Mancinelli or the printer. <em>Scribendi orandique modus</em>, by contrast, almost always appears with a chaste title page that includes the author and title and no other information.

The verso of the title page is blank and the entire recto of the second leaf is taken up by a table of contents, classically described as *Operis Tituli*. This page has a clear, tabular form for the first twenty chapters, and the page is footed with a paragraph-form description of chapter twenty one, the vocabulary. This last entry, called \"The Proper Meaning of Words\" (*Vocum proprietas*), names fourteen source texts for the lexicon. This distinctive form of contents listing indicates that Mancinelli viewed the last chapter as a sort of appendix, essentially a separate composition, and one that took its value from the list of important classical authorities on which it drew. Printers from the first edition forward emphasized this distinction by setting the text of the first twenty chapters in a single broad column in a large roman type and the last chapter in two narrow columns in much smaller type. (60)\n<p>The table is followed by a dedicatory letter to Valerio Crispiano of Velletri that occupies another entire page, so that the actual text of chapter one only begins on page five, a striking degree of spaciousness in a schoolbook. The dedication, moreover, is entirely ceremonial and makes no reference to the specific content of <em>Scribendi orandique modus</em> except to commend the dedicatee for oratorical skills he regularly displayed in the city council of Velletri. Since we know Mancinelli was on his way back to Velletri in July of 1493, and since he tells us elsewhere that within three days of his arrival the city fathers offered him a position as teacher there, it may be that this last \"Venetian\" work was really intended to mark, and to celebrate, his homecoming to small-town Lazio after two years in the North. Without too much license, we may imagine Mancinelli crossing the Apennines with a saddlebag full of elegant little textbooks for friends and notables in Velletri, some already bound in the latest Venetian styles.</p>\n<p>The typography of the <em>Scribendi orandique</em> is striking and original. Despite the small types typically used, it achieved an elegant look, based on the best small humanist manuscripts of school texts. In this respect it mirrors the equally distinctive layout of the <em>Lima in Vallam</em>, another text we know was composed and typeset during Mancinelli's last months in Venice. We can only assume that Mancinelli's own preferences are at work, together with the technical versatility of the presses at Venice, and perhaps the schoolmaster's increasing sensitivity to type and the possibilities it offered.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/3.00_Chapter_Three/Case-X-67.548,-Omnia-opera-Antonii-Mancinelli-Veliterni,-ver.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/3.00_Chapter_Three/Case-X-67.548,-Omnia-opera-Antonii-Mancinelli-Veliterni,-ver.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Late version of the table of contents (click to enlarge - </figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Even in the collected editions of Mancinelli's works that began to appear about 1500, the <em>Scribendi orandique modus</em> retained its characteristic typographical dress.

So the title has lost its blank verso; and the table of contents and dedicatory letter are squeezed onto a single page.

The tensions evident in his Valla prefaces may offer a clue, but it would be speculative to assume that they represent real discontent in Venice rather than a normal rivalry among humanists or an even more normal homesickness. (63) We do know that Mancinelli went back to Velletri, and that he had offers to work elsewhere at high salaries, prompted not by his scholarly writing but by his teaching reputation. So Venice had given him not only new publishing opportunities but also a quantifiable sense of his own worth on the market for teachers. (64)</p>\n<p>His Venetian years were probably his busiest, but back in Velletri Mancinelli did not just return to teaching. He continued his scholarly editorial work and continued to crank out small textbooks and reading anthologies, the genres of publication in which he had been most successful to date. Befitting his newly achieved middle age (he had just turned forty), the new classroom works were all strongly moralizing in character, if possible even more earnestly so than his earlier texts. Increasingly they anthologize his own experiences. Almost immediately on his return, he wrote the autobiography in verse that is the source for much of what we know of his life. (65) This <em>Vitae carmen</em> is also a self-advertisement, since it gives a list of his published works to date, omitting only those, like the <em>De rhetorica brachylogia</em>, that he considered superseded. After this date, we must rely on dated prefaces and printers' colophons to follow his career.</p>\n<p>Mancinelli seems to have returned from Venice with commissions in hand for additional scholarly editions of Strabo's <em>Geography</em>, of Herodotus in the Latin translation of Lorenzo Valla, and perhaps of Diodorus Siculus. The sponsor of Mancinelli's work on these books was Nicolò Rossi, canon of St. Mark's, who had been dedicatee of the commentary on Juvenal. In the event the Strabo and the Herodotus came from the presses of Giovanni Rossi and Gregorio de Gregori in spring of 1494, while the Diodorus seems never to have appeared. The 1494 prefaces imply that Mancinelli returned to Venice in April to deliver the Herodotus manuscript and perhaps to see it through the press, and that he completed work on the Strabo while there. The Herodotus preface is particularly informative as to the process, careful but not really thorough, which Ma</p>\n<p>A curiosity of the Strabo and Herodotus editions is that both have prefaces dated <em>after</em> the dates in the colophons of the books. (67) The reason is to be found in the circumstances of their preparation, since Mancinelli must have been pressed to get the corrected texts to the printer even as they worked. The preface to the Herodotus was written while the work on Strabo was still in hand. Reading between the lines, we may imagine that Mancinelli was feeding the sheets to the printer a few at a time. The Strabo preface contains the only real complaint Mancinelli ever published about printers, \"If there be any error in what you read, let it be put down not to my fault but rather to the haste of the printers.\" (68) The sentiment is commonplace by the fourteen nineties but it is striking coming from Mancinelli, usually so indulgent.</p>\n<p>In both the Strabo and the Herodotus editions the lengthy indexes and the brief dedication letters are front matter; they occupy a separate set of sheets at the beginning of the book. The Strabo dedication is dated fully three weeks after the body of the text, which gives some idea of the amount of time spent on the preparation of the indexes. Not that the indexes are particularly well made. They are accurate in the page references, but seem at first to be alphabetized only half-heartedly. In fact they are perfectly regular in a different way, for they give the entries under each initial letter in the order of their appearance in the book: all the a-words on the first leaf, then the a-words on the next leaf, and so forth. This too may simply be a result of the printer's haste; but when Rossi reprinted the Strabo in January of 1495 (only eight months after the first edition) he used the same index setting.

The <em>Mirror of Morals and Duties</em> (<em>Speculum de moribus et officiis</em>) is a verse treatment of the four cardinal virtues. It bears an interesting double dedication. A short, affectionate verse commending the work was addressed to Mancinelli's youngest son Festus. Mancinelli says the purpose of his work is double, to instruct in morals and to teach Latin. The first is the leader (or duke, <em>dux</em>) of the poem, the second its companion (or count, <em>comes</em>). Here Mancinelli offers his son both fatherly advice and also a schoolroom clarification (the technical term in grammar is <em>differentia</em>) between terms whose classical meaning had been distorted by their long use in feudal society. The verses to Festus are preceded by fourteen lines in praise of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (later Pope Paul III), a rare address by Mancinelli to a prince of the church. Farnese had been a student of Pomponio Leto and so was part of the Roman humanist circle by reason of real learning and intelligence as well as birth. Mancinelli's poem is punningly conventional. The cardinal exemplifies the cardinal virtues, so he is the perfect judge (<em>optimus censor</em>) of a poem on morals.</p>\n<p><em>Marketplace of Latin Speech</em> (<em>Latini sermonis emporium</em>) is an Italian-to-Latin proverb and phrase book. Nearly seven hundred short phrases in Italian are given elegant Latin dress. There are proverbs like \"œIt's better to be a doctor than an unlearned man, said Aristippus\" or \"œDon't be slow to learn,\" but also commonplace and even colloquial phrases, \"œI was forced to do it\" and \"œSet the table.\" The logic of such a compilation is set out in the brief dedication. Even young children, Mancinelli says, should be encouraged to use Latin conversationally. (70)</p>\n<p>Three other anthologies bring together classical extracts with original verse and prose by Mancinelli. They were offered in print as Latin reading books. Collected in Velletri, Orvieto and Rome in Mancinelli's later years, they were published first in Rome. (71) The first anthology, <em>On the Care of Parents for their Children, and On the Reciprocal Obedience, Honor and Reverence Due to Parents from their Children</em>, took inspiration from Mancinelli's own family life. It consists of extracts from classical, biblical, and patristic sources. Mancinelli coyly included an extract from his own recent <em>Speculum de moribus et officiis</em>.</p>\n<p>This <em>Care of Parents</em> was never published separately and first appeared in 1503 along with <em>A Decade of Speeches</em> (<em>Sermonum decas</em>). The two works were reprinted almost immediately in Milan. (72) In publishing terms, then, they were originally a single anthology on moral themes, but each was reprinted separately later. The <em>Decade</em> is a collection of Mancinelli's occasional speeches and letters, arranged in ten books by subject. The dedication was to the single most prominent intellectual among Mancinelli's dedicatees, Angelo Colocci (1474-1549), a renowned antiquary and editor who was at this date moving up the ranks within the papal curia. (73) Mancinelli's greeted Colocci with an exact curial title, but the body of the brief letter was affectionate, in the Ciceronian manner of learned friendships of the day. Collocci was twenty years Mancinelli's junior, a fact the latter emphasized by recalling the accomplishments of Colocci's father and paternal uncle. Always the schoolmaster, Mancinel</p>\n<p>Also from about 1503, the <em>Little Book of Epigrams</em> (<em>Epigrammaton libellus</em>) and <em>Fourfold Suite of Eclogues</em> (<em>Aepolion Aeglogarum quattuor</em>) are collections of Mancinelli's short verse. They offer a microcosm of the life of a small town in the shadow of papal Rome, including ceremonial poems, epitaphs, and verses that mirror Mancinelli's interests. (74) The largest single group concerns marriage, and the next most prominent theme is Latin education as a preparation for the moral life. The conventionality of such themes, of course, does not detract from their importance both in humanist thought and in Mancinelli's own life. Exactly these most deeply held beliefs needed stating, repeatedly and eloquently.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we should remark four apparently lost works. Mancinelli seems to claim in his 1493 autobiographical poem that he had composed a set of glosses on Valerius Maximus, but they have never been identified. (75) We really know nothing about the other three lost works except that they are mentioned in lists starting in 1490. All three were apparently anthologies, like those we have met before, from classical authors. The title <em>Centiloquium</em> (<em>One Hundred Sayings</em>) alas, tells us nothing of the contents, merely that there were a hundred entries. <em>Platonis sententiae</em> (<em>Sayings of Plato</em>) and <em>Aristotelis sententiae ex Ethicis, Politicis, Oeconomicis</em> (<em>Sayings from Aristotle's Ethics, Politics and Economics</em>), on the other hand, are clear as to the sources of the extracts. Probably all three consisted of short passages intended for study by intermediate-level Latin students. They are unlikely to have been in Greek, since there is no evidence that Mancinelli ever taught Greek.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(70) The <em>Emporium</em> was printed as late as the 1550's with the preface redated to 1543, perhaps in error but more likely in an attempt to make the book seem more modern; Bersano 1966, 302.</li>\n<li>(71) Mellidi 2002, 143-150.</li>\n<li>(72) Mancinelli 1503b and 1504.</li>\n<li>(73) Rowland 1998, 83-85, 183.</li>\n<li>(74) Mellidi 2002, 148-150.</li>\n<li>(75) CTC 5:379.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Mancinelli's late works all aim to inculcate morals in Latin students.

In the manuscript age, they could be altered at any copying for the use of a specific teacher or student. (94) We tend to think that printed texts are inherently more stable, and they are so in two fundamental ways. First, printing created many identical or highly similar copies of a given work; and secondly, printed texts (absent manuscript variants) are easier to copy than to revise. As early as the 1470's these facts of printed-text inertia were cause for complaint among humanists who objected to poor texts of classical authors that got wide circulation because they were in print. (95) But even in the age of print, every edition was an opportunity for change. We have already observed Mancinelli's growing preoccupation with correction and enlargement, which he seemed to feel was a normal process of reprinting. Once the texts were out of his direct supervision, however, especially after his death, they were subject to detailed revision by other teachers.</p>\n<p>Practically every grammar master who published in this period faced the same problem of the need for revision and the concomitant urge to tinker, not only with his own original compositions but also with those of others that seemed useful but worth modifying for his own classroom. For example, the German humanist Johann Murmellius (1480-1517), whose career as a publishing teacher began in 1504 just as Mancinelli's was ending, typically published a second, \"improved\" edition of his schoolbooks within a year or two of the first editions. The improvements could involve significant enlargements, about fifteen percent in the case of his first printed work on verb conjugations. Or they could aim mostly at correcting typographical errors, as in the case of the second and subsequent editions of Murmellius' version of Mancinelli's <em>Versilogus</em> with commentary and original poetry by Murmellius. This anthology was published six times in the lifetime of the German schoolmaster. (96)</p>\n<p>A clear example of the unstable afterlife of grammatical schoolbooks is the wholesale appropriation of Mancinelli's works (and those of many other grammarians) by Josse Bade Ascensius. (97) As early as 1501, Bade incorporated Mancinelli's commentary on Lorenzo Valla into his own edition of the <em>Elegantiae</em>. Bade was usually careful to give attributions when he used other humanists' work, and indeed to claim on his title pages and in prefaces and marginalia that he had included them. Bade was both scholar and printer, so it was in his interest to advertise not only his own authority but also that of the other scholars whose work he reprinted.</p>\n<p>One of the clearest cases in which Bade both appropriated another scholar's work with attribution and also tampered with it without stating the changes was Mancinelli's <em>Carmen de figuris</em>. Mancinelli's short didactic poems were eminently practical; they were much reproduced both within and outside his immediate circle. The <em>Carmen de figuris</em> originally appeared as a separate booklet in August 1489, just five days before its companion piece the <em>Carmen de floribus</em>. Thereafter, these two works usually appeared in combined editions. In 1493 at Venice, for example, Mancinelli supervised a printing of this combination together with his newly composed autobiographical poem, the <em>Vitae carmen</em>. Subsequently, the <em>Carmen de figuris</em> was linked with other didactic poetry in small booklets published more or less under Mancinelli's direct supervision. In the collections made late in Mancinelli's life it had a clear position in the sequence of classroom poetry labeled <em>Carminum opuscula</em> that included as many as a dozen works. The <em>Carmen de figuris</em> almost always occurs together with the <em>de floribus</em> immediately after the <em>Versilogus</em> and before Mancinelli's extensive collection of epigrams. As such it has a place in a system of verse instruction that moves from simple moral instruction (the first work is <em>Speculum de moribus et officiis</em>), through technical instruction embodied in verse, and on to an anthology of moral sayings useful as starting points for composition even more than for moral self-education. (98)</p>\n<p>Already in 1505, the year before Mancinelli's death, Josse Bade began to publish a series of Mancinelli's classroom works. Usually the learned Paris printer furnished the texts with additional annotations. Sometimes he anthologized Mancinelli with other humanists. In 1508, for example, he included the <em>Carmen de figuris</em> in an edition of the grammar book of Giovanni Sulpizio (a contemporary of Mancinelli and like him a member of the circle of Pomponio Leto) as part of an appendix of several writers on the figures of speech. Curiously, Bade substituted six lines of his own composition for the first five lines of Mancinelli's poem. Clearly labeled <em>Mancinellus de figuris</em>, these read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Barbara scribendo fit siue loquendo figura</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Una in uoce; aliud more insueto superaddens\r\nDemens aut mutans seu transmutans: uti mavors\r\nPro mars; &#x26; fates pro fantes; asuenio pro\r\nAduenio, fors tymbrae legas pro timber eritque\r\nAccentu veluti dicendo domina eodemque.</em> (99)</p>\n<p>Compare this with Mancinelli's original, five verses which had stood for twenty years in all earlier editions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Fit barbarismus scribendo sive loquendo</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Adiicit ac demit mutat transmutat et idem\r\nUna in voce tamen mavors fates bene pandunt\r\nAsuenio tymbrae &#x26; pro mars fantes quoque tymber\r\nAdvenio: sic et dicendo domina dominus.</em> (100)</p>\n<p>Presumably Bade thought he had clarified the obscure verses of Mancinelli or improved the meter. But both versions were complex enough to require explanatory comment. Mancinelli had produced such a note, twenty three lines of prose to explicate five of poetry. The poem and commentary stand together in all earlier editions. Bade reproduced this commentary word for word in 1508 (though it refers to a different poem!) and then added his own notes, at about the same length as Mancinelli's, so that these few lines of poor mnemonic verse swell to a full page loaded down with learned commentary.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(94) On the instability of such texts of \"modesta cultura\" see Franceschini 2003, 63-65.</li>\n<li>(95) Rossini 1997, 104-111.</li>\n<li>(96) E.g.

Mancinelli himself had made lists of his works as they multiplied, which appeared in print in 1490, 1492, 1493, and again in 1499, but the context of these early lists was mere advertising. The 1492 list of twenty four works, for example, appeared in a Venice edition of <em>Regulae constructionis</em> with <em>Summa</em> and <em>Thesaurus</em>. It may have been a sort of calling card for Mancinelli, newly arrived in Venice, or it may have been intended to announce a plan by the printer, Giovanni Roscio, to start a series. It is a confusing list, however, since it incorrectly describes the <em>Spica</em> as a work on supines and it includes the mysterious <em>Centiloquium</em>, of which no copy survives. At best it is a garbled version of a list Mancinelli might have supplied in manuscript. (76)</p>\n<p>A larger, later project is similarly fuzzy in the earliest documents, which date from the beginning of 1498. Giovanni Tacuino had been issuing textbooks by Mancinelli for some years. On January 21, 1498 he published an edition of the <em>Regulae constructionis</em> with <em>Summa</em> and <em>Thesaurus</em> that contained a note listing twenty seven distinct works of Mancinelli, in no particular order. (77) This list, like that of 1492, included not only grammatical textbooks and reading anthologies, but also the commentaries on Virgil, Horace and Juvenal, and the <em>Centiloquium</em>. It also included the never-published <em>Lima</em> on Giovanni Tortelli and another (but different) mistaken description of Mancinelli's <em>Spica</em>. This disordered list cannot be Mancinelli's making. Most likely Tacuino cobbled it together from earlier lists or from the title pages of earlier publications in his stock that he intended to use as copy texts for new issues. This would explain why the commentary on Tortelli shows up, since it was listed on the title page of the Pincio edition of Tortelli even though it was never issued. (78)</p>\n<p>Soon after the list above, the project becomes a little clearer. On February 9, 1498, Tacuino reissued the Valla/<em>Ad Herennium</em> tracts. Some copies of this little volume bear a title page announcing an <em>Opera omnia</em>. (79) This title page implies that Tacuino now saw himself as publishing a complete set. Perhaps he saw the project as a way of keeping his presses busy in otherwise slow periods. If he still had earlier editions of some works in stock, he would have had no incentive to reprint them in a new format, but the new title page might create a demand for the older booklets. Both the older and new issues were in standard chancery quarto format and could be bound together as any given customer desired. In the event, Tacuino does not seem to have gone far or fast with the series. He reissued only four works in the next two years. On January 9, 1500 Tacuino received a privilege from the Venetian authorities that included \"all of Mancinelli's works together with a new commentary on Valerius Maximus.\" But neit</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, other printers also started collecting works of Mancinelli, probably spurred on by the announcement of Tacuino's project. Beyond the Alps, the Lyon printer Jean de Vingle carefully selected a few works to represent a complete curriculum from Donatus to the <em>Rhetorica ad Herennium</em>. (81) In Milan, the publisher Giovanni da Legnano began a grandly titled <em>Opera omnia</em>, starting with a Valla/<em>Ad Herennium</em> volume, just like Tacuino's issue of 1498. In fact the Milanese book is a close reprint of Tacuino's. The Milan book is undated but likely to have been printed in 1499 or 1</p>\n<p>The only clear indication we have that Mancinelli was personally involved in collecting his works is a preface dated 1504 which, however, first appeared with a 1507 <em>Opera omnia</em> title page by Tacuino. Mancinelli had died in the meantime, probably in 1505, and so here he was made to speak posthumously. He wrote that the project was to assemble the corrected works written for young boys and adolescents into a single volume, and then he gave a classified list, which is precious evidence for his retrospective sense of his own career. There are three classes, <em>Grammaticae Praeexercitamenta</em>, or preparatory exercises in grammar, <em>Carminum Opuscula</em>, short works in verse, and <em>Solutae orationis Opuscula</em>, short works in prose. (84) The list that appears under these headings is tantalizing. Missing are the commentaries on Juvenal, Horace and Virgil (presumably because Mancinelli did not see them as made for adolescent students), but included are the Valla and <em>Ad Herennium</em> commentaries. At the very end are the three lost anthologies -- Plato, Aristotle, and Centiloquium. If Mancinelli himself edited this list, it may be that the three \"lost\" anthologies were simply projects he still had in hand in 1504 and which he never completed.</p>\n<p>The evidence for Mancinelli's direct involvement in collecting his works is fragmentary, but, whoever came up with the idea initially, it seems that by 1504 the eminent author had been recruited to oversee the project. He started by imposing some order. For Tacuino, however, the order was still an afterthought. The title page with Mancinelli's logical classification dates from August 5, 1507; but the only copy of this <em>Opera omnia</em> I have seen contains more fascicles printed before that date than after. The title page was merely Tacuino's device for encouraging customers to collect a set.

The De Legnano booklets are very rare but significant groups of them survive at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, at the Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal, and at the Free Library of Philadelphia. Ambrosiana, Inc. 830-835 was kindly examined for me by Angela Nuovo and Gigliola Barbero, who report that it bears the ownership mark of collector Ambrogio Archinto (1481-1518). Copinger 1898, 20 records five of the Milan booklets that were once bound together; today those copies are separates in the collection of the Free Library of Philadelphia. Unlike the others in the series the <em>Donatus</em> must have circulated frequently as a separate to judge from the fact that it survives in larger numbers than the others and more often separately than in a set. Between 1503 and 1505, Mantegazza printed another series of Mancinelli's works for the printer/publisher Gottardo da Ponte; Sandal 1978, 65-67. And again, around 1505 the Paris scholar/printer Josse Bade Ascensius began issuing groups of Mancinelli's works. The demand for such collections may be gauged by the fact that several early assemblies of them survive into our own day, usually bringing together many pamphlet-sized works by the same printer or publisher, e.g.Padua, Universitaria 107.b.140; Pavia, Universitaria III.B.20.

But this would miss an essential aspect of Latin grammatical writing and publishing. There are really only two cases in which much originality is to be expected in grammar and therefore in which a new grammatical text does not merely rewrite traditional teachings. There is the rare transformative moment when a pedagogical genius succeeds in radically reforming a curriculum. And there is the slower and more archaeological process by which the grammatical usage of a particular past age is reconstructed and reclaimed. The humanist endeavor of the fifteenth century claimed to be both of these things; but in fact it was original only in the second, archaeological sense of identifying a coherent period of great Latin and recreating it for contemporary use. (101)</p>\n<p>The fruits of such philological work necessarily invited rethinking and rewriting the basic textbooks, and the extraordinary productivity of Mancinelli was occasioned by this need. But the force of classroom tradition meant that teaching methods did not change much in the first age of print. Indeed, the inertia of the old manuscript culture meant that Mancinelli met opposition even on the level of reforming the most basic classroom texts, the demonstrably faulty Donat and Cato. His enemies, whom he described as ignorant men who knew how to teach only the faulty Latin they themselves had learned, were teachers at the most basic level with careers like his own. For some such elementary teachers, rote memory was not only a fundamental teaching technique, it was also the limit of their own learning and intellectual ambition. Their discipline was a grammatical fundamentalism with an inviolable scripture, the poor medieval Donat.</p>\n<p>When Mancinelli turned to original literary and philological work, he had to tackle the weighty reputation of Lorenzo Valla, the first great archaeologist of classical Latin. Here he met resistance not from fundamentalist grammar masters but from a considerable cadre of followers and other admirers of the justly famous philologist. These were learned men, comparatively speaking, and Mancinelli probably found their opposition baffling. They were willing to accept Valla's conclusions and to adopt the taste for classical usage he propounded, but without understanding or actively taking up the critical methods that got Valla to those conclusions. Mancinelli excused himself to this audience with an explanation that his own methods were just an extension of those pioneered by Valla. But Mancinelli eventually placed these men in the same category of intellectual sinners -- the stubbornly ignorant who have learned something one way and do not intend to un-learn it. The true humanist, for Mancinelli, was one who had internalized not on</p>\n<p>Josse Bade, then, and other editors of grammatical texts at the turn of the century were continuing two strands of editorial work-in-progress, work well begun by Valla, Mancinelli, and their contemporaries. Both traditions conduced to instability for grammatical textbooks. First, like grammatical writers for centuries before and after, the humanists worked ongoing transformations on the texts used in the classroom to make them more useful for students. They were limited in what they could do with some of the most widely used</p>\n<p>Secondly, even normative texts -- reference grammars, dictionaries, commentaries on the major school authors, and the classical authors themselves -- were subject to continuous revision, not because they were inherently unstable like class texts but because of the ongoing progress of humanist research. The example of Josse Bade is again instructive. Whether editing Mancinelli's commentary on the <em>Ad Herennium</em>, incorporating Mancinelli's notes on Virgil into his own editions, or adding a second layer of commentary to Mancinelli's <em>Lima in Vallam</em>, Bade was playing the humanist philologist. The professional conventions in this case were the same that Mancinelli had observed in his own scholarly editing -- to reproduce and label what came from earlier philologists, to argue with it openly when it seemed wrong or misleading, or else to omit it selectively. By the 1490's it was essential in advertising such editions to claim that they incorporated the opinions of many scholars. The public for classical editions wanted as much of the scholarly apparatus as they could get.</p>\n<p>Aldo Manuzio, already within Mancinelli's lifetime, would offer a completely different publishing model. The Aldine editions were not just handsome new packages. They succeeded because they were careful, scholarly editions of the classics that presented only text and no commentary at all. It was a daring experiment, made possible only because Aldus's reputation and that of the editors he employed was already well recognized.

This collection had the patronage of publisher Leonardo Vegio, who had the means to command a fully integrated set of thirty one works in nine separate fascicles issued between July and December of 1509. These are again reprints of Tacuino's editions, but they have a prettified title page that reads <em>Opera omnia</em> and follows with a full list of works printed in black and red. (86)</p>\n<p>Leonardo Vegio's collection is important because it represents sophisticated packaging specifically for classroom use. Vegio gave each of the nine fascicles a separate title page so they could be had in the traditional form, as separates, if the customer wanted them that way. Indeed, we must suppose that for teaching purposes, students would normally be given one fascicle at a time. Some of the fascicles with a single title page are set and signed in such a way that they could be further broken down for classroom use. For example, the second fascicle has a title page that unites the <em>Thesaurus de constructione</em>, the <em>Latini sermonis emporium</em>, and the <em>Speculum de moribus</em> with other small moral poems. All are elementary works, but they would not necessarily be used in the same way or at the same time. The <em>Thesaurus</em>, in three gatherings, is signed a through c; the <em>Emporium</em> has a caption title and is gathered AA and BB; and the remaining small works, introduced by a new title page, run from aa to cc, three gatherings again. Even if it were only offered for sale as a single item, such an eight-gathering booklet could be separated for student use into three shorter pamphlets. Vegio and Mantegazza also imposed a uniform typographical style on their series, with regular use of types and carefully crafted running heads, so as to make for a genuine collection, usable as such. In the case of the fascicle described above, each separate work has running heads that make it clear where it begins and ends, simplifying consultation of the collected set and clarifying for the binder which leaves are which. All in all, these Vegio imprints are the most handsome presentation Mancinelli's school texts ever received. Another entrepreneurial Milan printer, Nicolò Gorgonzola, seems to have started yet another collected works of Mancinelli; seven titles survive.

Although he copied many aspects of the Vegio/Mantegazza printings, including the running heads, Rusconi's production standards were not as high. The heads are often erroneous; the signing is confused; and although there are cross-references from fascicle to fascicle, they are as often wrong as right.

In the fascicle corresponding to the one we described above for the Milan edition, for example, the same three works appeared in the same order. Instead of starting the signing anew in each subsection as the Milanese printer had done, Rusconi added the title THESAV.MAN (<em>Thesaurus Mancinelli</em>) to the bottom of the first and third leaves of signatures A and B, and SPECV.MAN (<em>Speculum Mancinelli</em>) to the first and third leaves of gatherings E, F, and G.

(88) It makes best sense in the case of books stored in sheets in a bookshop, for it would allow the bookseller to pull only the sheets for a single work if that is all the buyer wanted. There is clear evidence that this was its meaning in Rusconi's shop. Apparently the 1519 <em>Opera omnia</em> of Mancinelli was available in three different ways. Rusconi offered individual works, composite units (two or three works each behind a single title page), and the series as a whole. The most common surviving form is the collected works with their <em>Opera omnia</em> title page. The composite fascicles also survive with some regularity. (89)</p>\n<p>Single-work pamphlets survive much more rarely to evidence this shop practice of using catch-titles; or perhaps more precisely, pamphlets of the sort have rarely been identified and cataloged. They may in fact be common but misidentified. As it happens, just in the case of this 1519 Rusconi edition, two such single works can be found in Illinois libraries. One at the Newberry Library in Chicago is a separate detached from the <em>Thesaurus/Emporium/Speculum</em> fascicle just described. It contains just the <em>Emporium</em>. A second such separate is held by the University of Illinois. It contains the <em>Epigrammaton libellus</em> and derives from a fascicle that once contained the <em>De floribus</em> and <em>De figuris</em>. It is presently bound with a complete but different fascicle, one that contains the <em>Sermonum decas</em> and other prose works. (90) The fact that catch-titles, though common in Venice in Mancinelli's day, do not appear in any of his works as printed in his lifetime suggests that he did not approve of the practice. It is a purely typographic usage, unrelated to the classic look of humanist manuscripts. It may have been uncongenial to Mancinelli for that reason alone.</p>\n<p>Although Rusconi's collected edition was very successful, other Venetian and Milanese printers did not simply cede Mancinelli's works to Rusconi. Giovanni Tacuino issued all the works separately between 1518 and 1526, and added an <em>Omnia opera</em> title page in the latter year to a <em>Donatus melior</em>. This time he copied the Milan edition, not Rusconi's. (91) Other printers offered individual works with some regularity for another thirty five years. The most popular would seem to have been the basic grammar unit, <em>Regulae constructionis</em> with <em>Summa declinationis</em>. First published as a combination in 1490, it got a printing as late as 1563 by Francesco Lorenzini. The presses of the Nicolini da Sabbio family issued this and other short works repeatedly between 1526 and 1550. In 1536, one large Milan bookseller had in stock no fewer than 358 copies of the <em>Donatus melior</em>, 709 of the <em>Scribendi orandique modus</em>, 198 of the <em>Spica</em> and 409 of the <em>Speculum de moribus</em>. (92) All in all, Mancinelli's was a remarkably long career for a textbook author. His most elementary grammar books were particularly durable. Apparently some teachers continued to take to heart the advertising phrase that Tacuino had put in Mancinelli's mouth on one of the first editions after his death, \"Whoever wants to become learned quickly, let him study my eight little textbooks.\" (93)</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(86) On Vegio, Sandal 1978, 53-60.</li>\n<li>(87) Gorgonzola, well known for copying the successful works of other Milan publishers, printed at least one Mancinelli title for Leonardo Vegio in 1509 and then, starting in 1511, began issuing others under his own imprint.

It was a field in which non-Italians were either latecomers or simply did not count for much. For this reason, and perhaps also because most Northern humanists had relatively few direct relationships of patronage with Italian publishers, the Italian market of the late fifteenth and sixteenth century remained remarkably impervious both to printed editions of the medieval grammars popular in Northern Europe and to the many new teaching grammars produced there during the Renaissance. Such textbooks were known in Italy, even imitated there; but they were not as popular or as widely used as native products. Only after the middle of the sixteenth century did this begin to change.</p>\n<p>Geographical writing for schools and popular audiences offers an informative parallel to the fate of these Northern European grammars. Italians felt they should own this genre of humanist writing too. As a literary pursuit, it was a tradition going back to the thirteenth century. The earliest humanists, Petrarch and Boccaccio, had tried their hand at didactic geography. Italians in the fifteenth century also pioneered in mathematical cosmology and cartography. (1) But, Christopher Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci notwithstanding, the European reconnaissance was not to be an Italian enterprise; and scientific geography would not be an Italian monopoly in the sixteenth century, especially with the decline of Venetian map making after 1560. Early Italian writers \"imported\" their understandings of geography from the ancient world and the Muslim East. Later, after printing made imports of books even easier, many Italian writers and publishers took inspiration from the European North.</p>\n<p>Geography textbooks were unlike Latin grammars in two important respects. First, there were fewer scholarly prejudices. Northern writers on geography, unlike grammarians, were immediately studied and imitated in Italy. Some of the most successful basic textbooks for geography in the sixteenth century were widely imported from Germany and Switzerland and repackaged for the Italian market. Secondly, geography was of such great popular interest that learned lore in the field was translated into the vernaculars at all periods. Long before there were textbooks for Italian language study -- indeed well before printing -- there were elementary vernacular treatments of geographical matters. Geography and cosmology were multilingual fields before the invention of printing; and printers could find a variety of manuscript</p>\n<p>In this chapter, then, we will explore several kinds of \"importation,\" for it was as much a crossing of borders to translate classicizing Latin culture into colloquial Italian as to bring books from outside Italy and rework them for Italian readers. First we will consider a straightforward case of importation, the limited success of three Northern Latin grammarians on the Italian market. Then we will look briefly at the making of elementary geography books, also largely imports. Sometimes Italians imported them in fact, but almost always they \"imported\" basic geography in the larger sense of translating it from one cultural realm to another. In a later chapter (sections 6.01 and 6.10) we will take up this latter kind of cultural translation -- Latin to vernacular -- in greater detail in other fields of study.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(1) Durand 1943, 1-9; Auzzas 1986, 343-344; Cornish 2000, 167-171.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Humanist philology, in the eyes of most Italians of the fifteenth century, was an Italian invention.

Jan de Spauter (ca 1460 -1520), Josse Bade Ascensius (1463-1535), and Jean Pellisson (ca. 1500-1567) were all connected in one or another degree with Erasmus or Erasmianism, but none of them was personally suspect of heterodoxy. Their grammatical works were rather conservative pedagogically (at least by comparison to Italian contemporaries) because they took over a great deal from the medieval grammatical tradition. (9) All three saw their own works or each other's through multiple editions in several countries of the North. All had teaching reputations sufficient to ensure that their elementary grammar books remained in print for a half century and more after their deaths. Italian publishers attempted to trade on their fame with textbooks issued under their names; but their works met varying and limited success in Italy. (10)</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this chapter, I will discuss these three grammarians separately, starting with the eldest and ending with the youngest, but it should be kept in mind that the three were at work across an overlapping period of about seventy-five years. Their careers were inextricably linked, largely through the vicissitudes of the press at Paris between 1508 and 1540. Bade was both publisher and scholar, and he was one of De Spauter's editors and printers at Paris from 1508 until the latter's death in 1520. Bade was so prolific a publisher of the schoolbooks of others like De Spauter that his own elementary grammar book was relatively little known even to faithful customers of his press. An ambitious young Pellisson edited and reworked De Spauter in the late 1520's for another Paris publisher. De Spauter, Bade, and Pellisson, then, were all part of a lively and influential humanist milieu of the early sixteenth century which the youngest of them vaunted in 1529 as \"the schools of Paris, which own the reputation of authority throughout the world for teaching and forming youths in good letters.\" (11) Italians at that date, needless to say, would not have agreed.</p>\n<p>Most editions of De Spauter that appeared in Italy derived from and were accompanied by work of Bade or Pellisson or both, and many of the editions of Pellisson's original schoolbooks were merely add-ons to his adaptation of De Spauter's better-known work. To borrow a term from one of Pellisson's titles, all three of them (and many other Northern teachers of the period) were \"Despauterian\" grammar masters, by sharp distinction to native Italian traditions of teaching and publishing. Of the three, De Spauter had by far the largest reputation, in Italy as elsewhere, because his innovative teaching methods were claimed by many who published him or who rewrote his work for new markets. The other two pedagogues sold in Italy largely as editors of De Spauter or of other humanist authors. We might view them, therefore, as parasitical in Italian publishing terms, no matter how great their personal reputations for learning and teaching were at home. A reading of the printing history of these three renowned grammar masters will offer an index of the degree to which the textbook markets of Italy were open to foreigners.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(9) Colombat 1993, 99; Colombat 1999, 38; Crane 2005, 76-89.</li>\n<li>(10) Some portions of this chapter that concern the marketing of Pellisson's textbooks have already appeared in Gehl 2008c.

This opinion had immediate resonance in the market for intermediate and advanced textbooks. For example, in the classroom scene that stands as frontispiece to the 1504 Venice edition of <em>Terence with Five Commentaries</em>, the Belgian-born Paris editor Josse Bade Ascensius is pictured to the right of a professorial Terence; he joins two ancient commentators and two moderns, one French and one Italian, in the stylized lecture hall that stands in here for the humanist republic of letters. Bade may have earned his place because he had studied in Italy; certainly none of the other Northerners of his generation ranked so high in the eyes of the Italian public. (2) But more importantly still, he was part of a humanist world without borders.</p>\n<p>By contrast to this ideal, international world of advanced scholarship, much elementary school book publishing remained tied to local demand and local networks of patronage. Sixteenth-century Latin speakers thought globally but Latin teachers acted locally. There were repeated attempts to create an international market for textbooks for teaching Latin. Venice was the site of the first such marketing campaigns toward the end of the fifteenth century. Later, Basel, Lyon, Paris, and Antwerp would seek international markets. To some degree Venetian printers succeeded; they printed for the South German, Hungarian, and Dalmatian markets for example, and their books were influential throughout Europe. But this broad ambition was always counter-balanced by local interests and needs, expressed in markets where local teachers made choices. In chapter five we will explore one internationally successful elementary Latin grammar, that of Manuel Alvares, championed by the Jesuits.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/4.00_Chapter_Four/HFS_096.01.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/4.00_Chapter_Four/HFS_096.01.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Erarsmus of 1538 (with a censor's note added) (click to enlarge - 529 KB JPEG image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Only a humanist celebrity like Erasmus (1467-1536) could expect his Latin school texts to be published in Italy promptly. And Erasmus, once his works became controversial and suspect of Lutheranism, slowly but thoroughly disappeared from the Italian market too. Even technical and pedagogical works that were never expressly forbidden (and which, indeed, contained nothing even remotely heterodox) went into eclipse as soon as Erasmus's name appeared in early indexes of forbidden books. Silvana Seidel Menchi has shown how selective and tendentious readings of Erasmus could indeed conduce to heterodoxy, and how, therefore, the authorities had every reason to worry about an author so widely read and anthologized. (3)</p>\n<p>Surviving copies of Erasmus's educational works bear traces of ambiguous attitudes by the censors. His name was sometimes obliterated without actually censoring his work. Alternatively, long discursive passages from his pen might be excised without removing other sections also of his making. Early editions of Aldo Manuzio's grammar book proudly advertised that it included Erasmus's treatment of the parts of speech. Later editions included the same uncontroversial material but suppressed the title page mention; and many copies of the earlier editions have the name of Erasmus carefully blotted from the title page. (4) One copy of a 1567 Estienne anthology of Greek drama preserves the text of Erasmus's translation of Euripides in full, but the two leaves with his preface were cut out and his name was inked out in the running head on every page. None of this was mandated by the detailed instructions of the inquisito</p>\n<p>Erasmus's school texts almost always included large doses of his particular brand of Christian moralizing. At least one edition of his version of the <em>Distichs of Cato</em> was the subject of an inquiry by the Inquisition because it was suspected of crypto-Protestantism. (6) The <em>Colloquies</em>, which he frequently revised and enlarged, was a playful dialogue intended to rehearse students in conversation. But it was also a manual on manners and morals and it contained a lot of good natured criticism of churchmen. It was condemned early but remained widely influential, even in Italy. (7) A larger and more wandering anthology like the <em>Adagia</em>, a commonplace book intended for learners of all ages, was even more problematic for censors in that they could not easily discern which of the moral teachings it embodied might smack of Lutheranism. Better to ban it outright, or at least discourage its sale.</p>\n<p>The same suspicion of heresy that limited the reception of Erasmus's works in Italy affected other Northern authors from mid-century forward, even though grammar was not a field easily susceptible to heresy. His Latin grammar was often the first book a boy would own. To the considerable degree that humanist pedagogy insisted on the morally normative force of teaching Latin, these first books in Latin were considered important to the eventual formation of the student's character. (8) Even before the fear of heresy affected the Italian market, however, Northern authors were viewed as superfluous in the Italian-dominated field of elementary humanist education, suspect not of heresy but merely for being not-Italian, perhaps therefore coarse and un-Roman in speech, and certainly unsophisticated. As a result, the Italian market for grammar textbooks remained largely an Italian affair.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(2) On the iconography, Rozzo 1998, 43-44.</li>\n<li>(3) Seidel Menchi 1987, 123-142.</li>\n<li>(4) Manuzio 1543 and 1551; the copies at University of Illinois/Urbana-Champaign have title pages with this cancellation.

He studied at Louvain during the years Erasmus was there, and he was both a personal friend of Erasmus and a kindred soul in educational terms. The only known tension in their relationship came in 1508 when De Spauter published some of Erasmus's work on letter theory in a form Erasmus felt was undigested. The incident was entirely typical of their milieu. Scholars who worked in the shadow of the Trilingual College at Louvain were so intensely enthused by the heady results of their pedagogical experience that they fairly jostled to create new textbooks and to present the fruits of their humanist education to the broad public made possible by print. De Spauter rushed his own works to print and repeatedly re-issued them with additions and corrections. It seems that the presses could hardly keep up with him; in turn he had to scramble to keep his works from multiplying beyond his control. By mid-century, De Spauter's grammatical works had become so popular that his name, in the forms \"Despauterius\" or \"DespautÃ¨re,\" had become almost synonymous in France with \"grammar book.\" (15)</p>\n<p>The cause of De Spauter's popularity was his teaching method, which consisted of organizing the whole of Latin grammar into short, easily memorizable bits that embraced both the rules and the many exceptions that bedeviled schoolboys. Medieval Latinists had tolerated neologisms that smoothed out the thorny irregularity of classical Latin because new words were formed mechanically on the basis of old, regular forms. With the rebirth of stylistics closely modeled on ancient writers, it became necessary to master an ever-larger vocabulary and many more irregular forms. (16)</p>\n<p>One early title page advertised De Spauter's teaching method thus: \" ... by inquiries and rules (but without the nonsense of sophists) all matters are clearly and easily digested.\" (17) The system depended on the ability of printers to reproduce the lessons in distinctive typographic dress so that the function of each section would be obvious and so that it would be clear which passages were to be memorized. On a typical page, De Spauter and his printers arranged several components: a rule; one or more examples of the Latin usage; parallel words or phrases in the vernacular to aid in immediate comprehension; and a rhymed couplet or two that repeated the rule and examples in memorizable doggerel. We have already seen the kernel of such a system in the classroom poems of Antonio Mancinelli who, like De Spauter, was adapting the pedagogical method of Alexander of Villa Dei's <em>Doctrinale</em> to better and more classical models. But De Spauter extended the practice from small groups of rules and limited, elementary vocabulary to the entirety of Latin grammar, and</p>\n<p>The typographic aspects of such a teaching system might be clearer if we examine a typical case, De Spauter's treatment of the use of ablative or accusative for answering place-name questions. A modern prescriptive grammar states this rule thus: \"The Names of Towns and words which follow their analogy are put 1. In the Accusative to denote the Place to Which. 2. In the Ablative to denote the Place from Which.\" This same grammar gives a single example of each usage. (19) De Spauter, by contrast, stated the rule first in verbose prose with numerous examples, and then in more concise</p>\n<p>The key to the Despauterian teaching system, however, was mnemonic and typographic. This prolix rule was first presented in paragraph form with type and formatting that indicate its role as an explanation to be read and discussed. It was also encapsulated in a thumping verse and re-presented in larger and bolder type, which indicated that it would be drilled and memorized. The verse in this case, belabored by generations of students, went something like this: \"Whenever you want to ask 'whence' or 'from where,' / Then you must put the sixth case there. / For 'to where\" or 'whither,' instead, / get the fourth case into your head. / Thus in place names, for ins and for outs, / or when you join two nouns like 'country' and 'house.'\" (20) A verse like this may have been easy to memorize by sheer rote, but even a student who could parrot it accurately might well not remember what it meant in practice. So the longer prose explanation with examples was essential both in classroom practice and on the page. (21)</p>\n<p>This much of Despauter's text was given to students and worked through in class. Many editions also include additional, closely set paragraphs of citations from classical literature, the \"authorities\" beloved of humanist scholars. These notes were intended for the teachers only, and there is some question with early editions of De Spauter whether they were truly student editions or teacher's manuals. One unambiguous case is constituted by the parallel editions issued by Robert Estienne starting in 1537. A grand folio was offered for teachers and modest quartos for students. (22)</p>\n<p>Schoolboys hated De Spauter's system for it gave them endless lines of bad verse to memorize. But teachers loved it, perhaps just because it absolved them from any more original or personalized teaching method. It reduced the vast forest of Latin grammar, difficult to traverse much less analyze and explain, to a large but limited number of thorny thickets, each with a set of drills. Teachers, of course, too often <em>merely</em> drilled; and the students were stuck with the uncongenial task of memorizing. No analysis needed, no explanations offered. Success for the student depended on a good memory, patience, and a strong will to please. The process of weeding out students who could not master the subject on these terms was relatively mechanical.

Humanist pedagogy in Italy, following Poggio Bracciolini's unqualified praise of the Cicero of the orations, had drifted into an often servile and mechanical Ciceronianism, especially on the level of vocabulary study. Some scholars see this phenomenon as a particularly Roman one, tied to the desire of humanists at the papal court to develop an oratorical Latin worthy of the universalizing mission of the church. In this view the crucial innovators were Poggio and Lorenzo Valla. Valla in fact advocated a balanced and eclectic study of a variety of ancient models expressly for the sake of developing a sense of the changing usages of ancient Latin and a better appreciation of the best stylists in their proper historical context; he considered Quintilian an authority on rhetoric equal to Cicero. Many of Poggio's and Valla's followers, however, took the shortcut of proclaiming Cicero the one and only good model, or even of using Valla's <em>Elegantiae</em> as an alternative canonical text by which to judge contemporary Latin. Even a Roman insider like Antonio Mancinelli protested this narrow-mindedness among contemporary Italian schoolmasters. By the end of the fifteenth century neo-Ciceronian Latin had developed at Rome into a sort of jargon used by curialists to define who was in and who out of the ruling circle. (12)</p>\n<p>Agnolo Poliziano detested this practice and Erasmus parodied it wickedly in his <em>Ciceronianus</em>. These great scholars had too broad an experience of both Latin and Greek authors to fall into the simplifying trap of making Cicero the sole model of style. Beneath the ridicule of Erasmus lay another, largely geographically defined difference of approach. The Northern humanists had never gone as far in revering Cicero as some Italians had; and they had fewer opportunities for composing and delivering Ciceronian orations than Italians, who were fond of trotting out a Latin orator (often the local schoolmaster) for every urban event. Northerners did not portray Latin as the illustrious forbear of their own modern vernaculars, a tendency most Italian humanists (Poliziano notably excepted) indulged at one time or another. Northern humanists, it is true, excelled at technical rhetoric and letter-writing on Ciceronian models. But the surviving works of Cicero on rhetoric are not complete, so the technicians had long recognized that they needed to look to other sources, especially Greek ones. And they did not limit their lexicon to that of Cicero. (13)</p>\n<p>One thing humanists all over Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth century shared was a pugnacious willingness to argue that derived from scholastic models. Petrarch made many innovations in humanist thought, among them introducing a sustained polemic against the scholastics. In so doing he also imported into humanism the quarrelsomeness of the universities, where disputation <em>pro</em> and <em>contra</em> was a permanent fixture. The theme of attack earned a similarly permanent place in humanism, first as a critique of scholastic Latin, then as criticism of medieval philosophy. But criticism back and forth, not necessarily constructive, also became part of humanists' dealings with each other. They did not typically indulge in the formal disputations favored by university scholars, but they favored dialogue-form literary works, and they exercised themselves in rhetorical invective on classical models. (14) The prefaces and afterwords of printed books became a favorite forum for such invective. We saw Antonio Mancinelli's early exercise of the sort in sections 3.10 and 3.11; even elementary schoolbooks were not free of such invective. Northern humanists of De Spauter's day were willing to defend their eclectic choices of literary models against Italian Ciceronians with controversial philology as well as parody.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(12) The best, recent overview of Italian Ciceronianism is Dellaneva 2007, esp. vii-xxvi.

Authorship became mere advertising when a publisher claimed to present so many things: original work of De Spauter; Josse Bade Ascensius as digest-maker, annotator, and editor; De Spauter as commentator both on Bade and on himself; and De Spauter yet again as critic of his own detractors. Some earlier editions are explicitly denigrated although they too came from De Spauter's pen. The publisher presented the public with an author who revisited his work on several occasions and who worked in constant dialogue with scholarly friend and foe alike. It may be that the dynamic pedagogy claimed on this visually lively title page was meant to distract from the fact that none of the protagonists was still alive. All that was new and improved here, with the possible exception of the index, was actually over fifteen years old by the time this book came off the press. The market offered many similar editions, so each title page had to compete for the attention of the choosy book buyer.</p>\n<p>Such marketing strategies were not necessarily imposed on an unwilling or unknowing De Spauter. Much of the rewriting described on this 1536 title page had been undertaken by him for earlier new editions. In a 1514 preface from his own pen, he was explicit about the marketing intentions of his revisions. Of the sample sentences in his most elementary textbook, he wrote, \"I have nowhere added vernacular equivalents, leaving this task to the teachers, for I wrote this little work not for our countrymen only, but rather for the French, Spanish, English and others.\" (25)</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(24) Spauter 1536b; see bibliography for full title.</li>\n<li>(25) Spauter 1536a, fol. 1v: <em>Vernaculum nusquam adieci, hanc provinciam preceptoribus relinquens, utique non nostratibus solum hoc opusculum scripsi, sed verum etiam Gallis, Hispanis, Anglis et caetera</em>.

He omitted Italy. Despite his internationalism, De Spauter's works were almost never used in Italy during his lifetime, and even later they were used mostly in editions prepared by Jean Pellisson or Josse Bade, to whom we now turn. Bade was born at Asse or Asche in Brabant, whence his self-applied surname, Ascensius. He studied first at Gand and Louvain and then for a number of years in Italy, but it was in France that he earned his reputation, first as a schoolmaster and then as publisher. Marriage was part of his career strategy. While teaching at Lyon in the 1480's he wed the daughter of printer Jean Trechsel, in whose shop he had been a proofreader. Bade's two sons eventually became colleagues in the Paris printing house he founded after the death of his father-in-law. Four of his six daughters married Paris printers, all of whom collaborated at one time or another with Bade. So Bade was transformed from pedagogue to publisher by marriage, and his ongoing business strategy likewise depended on family ties. (26)</p>\n<p>Bade's output as a publisher has been studied by Maurice Lebel, who notes that despite his close association with Erasmian circles, Bade chose to print little in Greek, and by Mark Crane, who remarks the strong presence of late scholastic texts in Bade's catalogue. As publisher, Bade concentrated on useful editions of Latin classics, on new Latin translations of Greek texts, on school books, on moral theology, and on liturgical and devotional works. His editions came to have a reputation for the correctness of their texts. (27) This mix of products was closely tailored to the Paris market. The taste for classics was large and growing in the university community there. It was especially marked among the many scholars of law and theology who felt the need to add a classical veneer to their academic pretensions. Scholars of this sort wanted to read a wide variety of classical authors; but good knowledge of Greek was still a rare achievement. Latin learning, by contrast, had been sufficiently reformed on humanist models that even this second-hand scholarly public insisted on good, classicizing translations and a generally high quality of textual editing. They were looking for Latin classics with extensive annotation by humanist scholars, and free of disfiguring medievalisms. There was also a growing market for Greek authors that extended well beyond the traditional interest in Aristotle and other philosophical texts. Parisians wanted to read the Greek historians and orators in good humanist Latin too. (28)</p>\n<p>Bade's participation in the liturgical/devotional market was typical of another sector of Paris printing of the day, aimed at the growing population of literate lay folk outside the university. That Bade would stress good texts in such a market no doubt reflected his humanist training. He may also have felt that it would give him an edge in this highly competitive field where the principal marketing strategy of many Paris printers was to ornament their editions with fancy borders and illustrations. In any case prayer books were a diversifying factor in Bade's output.</p>\n<p>As for school books, these represent Bade's greatest achievement, since it was in this field that he did his most innovative and experimental work. (29) We know a great deal about his marketing of these books because he provided so many of them with prefaces. Lebel counts forty five prefaces addressed directly to students, professors or booksellers; and, although he rarely spoke of printing or design, Bade frequently discussed the content and use of a given book, its intended audience or effect, and the scholarly controversies that raged in the field of literary education. (30) It is clear, moreover, that Bade devised an international strategy. He deliberately brought to the French market as many elementary and intermediate school texts as he could find in Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands. His long residence in Italy, where he had met scholar-teachers like Aldo Manuzio, Agnolo Poliziano, and Battista Spagnuoli Mantuanus, no doubt helped him acquire new texts for his press as well as the good will of their authors. (31)</p>\n<p>It is interesting to note how frequently Bade reprinted certain texts and in what varying guises. We have seen in an earlier chapter (section 2.15) that he first published his own commentary on the <em>Distichs of Cato</em> as part of a larger reference work on morals, then allowed it to be published as a separate by others, and only toward the end of his life reprinted it on his own presses. Bade's notes on Terence, intended from the first to supplement those of other commentators already in print, were similarly published by others -- no fewer than forty times within his lifetime -- but never from his own presses. (32) His editions of the medieval verse grammar of Alexander of Villa Dei represent a continuous process of improving and updating this still-standard work and adapting it to humanist norms of style.

This was true for great authors and minor ones alike. His editions of minor humanist authors like Giovanni Sulpizio or Antonio Mancinelli, for example, granted an additional twenty or thirty years to the published works whose vogue had nearly passed in Italy. He first commented on the little grammar book of Sulpizio for a Paris edition commissioned by Jean Petit in 1502. In the very next year, when his own press was up and running, he printed the text himself for Petit; and after 1506 he printed and published the work three times under his own imprint. Meanwhile other Paris, Caen, and London printers issued his text of Sulpizio on eight other occasions before 1530. (34) In the case of Mancinelli, Bade edited four separate works, publishing each himself first and then allowing many reprints by others while reprinting only once himself. (35) By 1518, his version of Mancinelli's works had become the standard text at Venice and Milan as well as in France, supplanting the versions edited by Mancinelli personally. Mancinelli's <em>Opera omnia</em> as known in later centuries contains Bade's text. Bade similarly promoted classroom works by Filippo Beroaldo the elder, Battista Spagnuoli Mantuanus, Lorenzo Valla, and Niccolo Perotti. (36)</p>\n<p>Without a doubt, however, Bade's greatest acts of boosterism were in promoting the works of Jan de Spauter. Between 1512 and 1521 (the final and most productive years of De Spauter's life) Bade printed five editions of De Spauter's <em>Grammatica</em>, seven of his <em>Art of Letter Writing</em> (<em>Ars Epistolica</em>), four of his <em>Art of Verse</em> (<em>Ars versificatoria</em>), three of his <em>Sytaxis</em>, two of the <em>Basic Introduction</em> (<em>Rudimenta</em>), and one of <em>On Figures of Speech</em> (<em>De Figuris</em>). (37) Later in the 1520's, there were additional Bade editions of every one of these works, as well as reprints of Bade's versions by other French, Flemish, and Italian printers. By the time of Bade's death in 1535, the \"Despauterius,\" a grammar that included a brief epitome and the full <em>Grammatica</em> of De Spauter (with or without annotation or additional short works), was virtually unchallenged as a basic Latin textbook in northern France and the Low Countries. It would remain in use in France (and her colonies abroad) into the seventeenth century, often in radically modified form. (38)</p>\n<p>Unlike his treatment of many other school authors, however, Bade did not usually preface De Spauter's work with a commendation from his own pen, nor did he add notes to De Spauter's already fulsome texts. Rather, he presented De Spauter's prefaces and texts pretty much as the author wrote them. Exception was made only for the <em>Ars versificatoria</em> and the <em>Syntaxis</em>, which have brief prefaces by Bade. In the first case, it was the frankly controversial nature of the book that prompted an apology by Bade; humanists were always ready to argue about prosody and De Spauter took on every previous writer on the subject by name. The <em>Syntaxis</em>, by contrast, is presented with a show-off piece by Bade, a ceremonia</p>\n<p>The preface to the <em>Ars versificatoria</em> is particularly interesting because Bade explicitly compared De Spauter's learning and method with that of Lorenzo Valla, Aldo Manuzio, and other Italian grammarians whose prestige was at high water mark in the first decades of the sixteenth century. Bade had great respect for Italian scholarship, but only insofar as he agreed with its results. He declined to accept the authority of Italian authors if they seemed to have made errors of interpretation, and he frequently followed medieval sources in place of modern ones. (39) He also took exception to the climate of attack and counter-attack that surrounded much philological scholarship and that De Spauter indulged in this work.</p>\n<p>Bade's preface is worth examining closely, since it can be read as a manifesto against the kind of <em>ad hominem</em> argument that bedeviled so much publishing in the age of Erasmus. As always, the prose is carefully crafted. First Bade sets the scene for his own unusual intervention:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here you have, learned reader, the versifying or stichological work of Jan de Spauter of Ninove together with his apology or recrimination against an adversary, which I have printed unwillingly, compelled to do so by the most just of reasons. For when he, contrary to the fathers' decree and Christian prescription, had already seen to the printing of two virtually defamatory pamphlets, it seemed disgraceful not to respond to those works, especially since he [De Spauter] could and indeed should have done so. (40)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bade is exaggerating De Spauter's forbearance here. In fact De Spauter was always ready to argue. Next Bade folded this imagined, mildly reasoning voice of De Spauter into his own, commending especially De Spauter's scholarly method and thoroughness:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For, since grammarians argue about many matters of interpretation, and the case is still being adjudicated, it is unfair to attribute fault to a man who follows good authorities rather than all authorities, especially when he follows better and certainly more ancient ones. For who in his right mind would not prefer Virgil or Lucan to Aldo concerning [the Latin name for] Ischia? And who, for that matter, would not prefer Servius and a whole Greek tradition of wise men to Annius of Viterbo on the matter of Monaco? (41)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bade then went on to praise De Spauter for his restraint in waiting to answer his critics until he could do so methodically and in the service of good letters and morals rather than, as so many do, for the sake of obtaining fame. He ended his conciliatory preface with an exhortation to Christian charity, a commonplace of humanist disputational prose. All these remarks worked to the same end, to blunt the inflammatory rhetoric of De Spauter; but interestingly, they did not spare Italians who might have erred. (42)</p>\n<p>Josse Bade's editions of De Spauter traveled in the international market, as evidenced in a collected volume of five of De Spauter's classroom works, all printed by Bade at Paris between 1511 and 1515 and now preserved in the library of the American Academy in Rome. This collection contains early notes in two hands, one perhaps French and the other Italian. The French annotator may have been close to the Paris circle of Bade himself because he makes reference to Lucio Giovanni Scoppa, a grammarian and editor who taught exclusively at Naples but whose commentary on Persius was included in one of Bade's editions a few years after the date of the items in this collected volume. The Italian notes are more extensive but they are not substantive; they serve merely to index some topics. Still, they tell us what interested one early Italian reader. Most of them index parts of the <em>Ars versificatoria</em> in which De Spauter criticized earlier authors. The errors of Alexander of Villa Dei are noted, but also those of Petrarch, Valla, and other Italian philological authorities. Most of the notes are matter-of-fact (\"an error of Tortelli and Calepino\"), but some seem a bit scandalized (\"Petrarch got it all mixed up\"). It would seem that Josse Bade had good reason to add a conciliatory preface to a work like this that took so many modern authors to task by name.

Ambitious but relatively unoriginal, he was thoroughly given to playing the game of publishing for personal advancement. He was a company man before the fact, something his prefaces and annotations evidence clearly. Pellisson was self-conscious about his own pedagogical practice and advocated strongly for methods he had used with success in the classroom. Always, however, he phrased his remarks in praise of the work to hand, and so his prefaces read like advertisements of a very modern sort. They were product endorsements by a prominent educator who participated intellectually and financially in preparing new editions of textbooks.</p>\n<p>Pellisson called his first grammar book indifferently <em>Progymnasmata</em> (meaning elementary exercises) or <em>Rudimenta</em> (<em>Introduction</em> -- this last appears on all surviving title pages). He was emphasizing that it derived from his own classroom exercises. The book was devised about 1522, he tells us, as a simplification of the drills in De Spauter's collected works, but no copy survives of the early editions he mentions. In an earlier chapter (section 3.02), we saw the 1529 preface to the revised <em>Rudimenta</em> where, by contrast to Antonio Mancinelli's matter-of-fact notion that teaching texts benefit by print, Pellisson complained that once in print, his exercises were reprinted without his knowledge and outside his control, so that classroom informalities and minor errors multiplied wildly. (44) In the same preface of 1529, he expanded on his philosophy of teaching and textbook making. He insisted that no grammar book teaches by itself, and that students learn only under the attentive guidance of a good master. This remark, though it echoes a commonplace as old as humanism itself, seems aimed at those contemporaries who embraced the grammar books of De Spauter uncritically as easy to teach. Pellisson said instead that, although De Spauter's system was a good one, his textbooks only seemed easy because they reduced everything to the memorization of rules. This appealed to lazy teachers but not to good ones.</p>\n<p>In this regard, Pellisson in 1529 was also picking up on an idea that had been articulated by Niccolò Perotti in the fourteen seventies, that the memorization of endless rules was not good pedagogy. For Perotti, memorization was to be reserved for classical texts and vocabulary. (45) Aldo Manuzio, whose authority in Northern Europe was considerable, had sounded a similar theme in his elementary grammar of 1493 and repeated it with emphasis in editions of 1501 and later that had wide currency among professional grammarians, especially in the North:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I would like you to keep in mind another thing, namely that you do not force the boys to learn anything except from the most learned authors. Indeed, I recommend their not even learning grammatical rules except in the briefest formulae that they can easily memorize, but they should only learn how to decline nouns and verbs so they can read the rules accurately and carefully. For, when we force them to memorize complex things, whether in verse or prose, even about the art [of grammar], then we fall into error in many ways. First of all because the things they learned with enormous toil they will unlearn in a matter of days. (46)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With the authority of Manuzio and Perotti, it became a humanist commonplace that the multiplication of rules to memorize, especially those in modern Latin doggerel after the fashion of De Spauter, was bad practice on several levels. It did not take into account the abilities and preferences of students and it gave them the worst sort of models to imitate.</p>\n<p>Jean Pellisson, though he considered himself a Despauterian and composed primarily by abbreviating De Spauter's work, could not entirely escape the influence of Manuzio's and Perotti's ideas. Pellisson's solution was a political and marketing move, one that succeeded well. Pellisson proposed a considerably simpler rule book, based on De Spauter's but much abbreviated. It was intended to give structure to the course but left more to the individual teacher's initiative. The teacher was to evaluate the skills and preferences of his students and adjust the content and speed of the course accordingly. This principled stance does not mean that Pellisson dispensed with Despauterian drills.</p>\n<p>Instead, he proposed a three-step overall plan for basic Latin. The first step involved memorizing a few already-familiar prayers in classicizing verse paraphrases. Ostensibly this taught the basics of Christianity, but the practice of paraphrase was also intended to force students to observe the differences between poetry and prose, and between classical and ecclesiastical Latin style. Next, students would work through Pellisson's short-form rules by drilling the inflections. In this stage they also began reading Terence and Cicero, where many finer points of grammar could be observed.. In a third moment they would return to rules for the major concepts of syntax. Pellisson's <em>Rudimenta</em> follows this scheme exactly.

This abbreviated version of De Spauter was prepared in 1529, the same year as the revision of Pellisson's <em>Rudimenta</em>. It would seem that Pellisson and his publisher had in mind that they would be marketed together. Certainly, they intended the new package not as a teacher's edition, but one that could be put into the hands of students without fear of confusing them with the excessive detail that characterized earlier versions of the Despauterius. Our sense of their editorial intent is somewhat blurred, however, by rates of survival. Both works have prefatory letters dated 1529, but the first editions to survive are of 1533 (<em>Rudimenta</em>) and 1532 (<em>Contextus</em>). After 1538, the <em>Rudimenta</em> often appeared as the second part of a book with a title page that names only the <em>Contextus</em>.</p>\n<p>Both the <em>Contextus</em> and the <em>Rudimenta</em> were reprinted frequently in France --together and separately-- across the remainder of the sixteenth century. Their fate was different in Italy, where it took several decades before these books gained any currency. There were a few Italian editions up to 1540, by way of proposing this fashionable new work by a Frenchman to the Italian market, but then both works virtually went out of print in Italy for a decade or more. Handsome editions of the fifteen forties and fifties printed at Lyon could have been had in Italy in the meantime. Again in the fifteen fifties there seems to have been unsuccessful attempts at Rome and Genoa to propose Pellisson's grammar books. (48)</p>\n<p>Pellisson's Despauterian method was picked up seriously and successfully in Italy only in the fifteen sixties. The highly productive and competitive presses at Venice made it over into an Italian phenomenon. Indeed, it achieved a certain vogue, for there were no fewer than fifteen Italian printings of the <em>Contextus</em> or the <em>Rudimenta</em> in the fifteen seventies, another nine in the eighties, and at least six more in the nineties. The <em>Contextus</em> and <em>Rudimenta</em> were reprinted at Venice as late as 1620. Alas, the late sixteenth-century Italian editions rarely have any front matter other than Pellisson's own prefaces, so there is no direct evidence as to why they were so popular. As we will see in chapter five, the 1570s saw the rapid expansion of the Jesuit schools, where the first Latin course was dominated by the <em>Grammatica</em> of Manuel Alvares, S.J. It may be that Pellisson's De Spauter was offered as an alternative for school masters who did not want to adopt the new Jesuit grammar. That Pellisson's Despauterian pedagogy could be considered consistent with traditionalizing (anti-Jesuit) grammatical instruction is suggested by the case of a surviving Pellisson <em>Contextus</em> and <em>Rudimenta</em> bound together with a contemporary edition of Guarino, an old standby of the humanist curriculum.

Pellisson and his publishers, however, went further and tried to package the classroom experience itself. For example, some but not all editions of the <em>Rudimenta</em> contain an appendix on syntax that demonstrates a question and answer fashion of parsing literary texts. This appendix is a bit of an oddment in that it both offered an exercise in sample prose and also made larger claims. It is presented as a specimen classroom dialogue, showing what Pellisson imagined a good teacher would do in class when approaching a literary text. The speakers, a grammar master and a student, are reading the first of Cicero's <em>Epistolae familiares</em> together. The student is asked to read aloud, and we immediately discover that he has some experience in this parsing exercise because he stops at the end of a rhetorical period and says he is doing so. With prompting, he is made to define the meaning of \"period\" and provide an etymology for it. When he cites Quintilian and then divides the period into its parts, it becomes clear that this is</p>\n<p>Amidst all the definitions, however, Pellisson's teacher and student did manage to detail a procedure for reading literary texts. The text, in this case Cicero, is to be broken into periods and these are taken apart one by one. The student is to rearrange each period from classical word order into \"œscholastic\" order, that is, according to the order of modern languages. This new order is understood very mechanically: vocative if any, nominative, verb with pertinent adverbs, and then any words governed by the verb. If there are words left over, the student must find a place for them within this rigid formula. To do this he runs through a memorized list of possibilities -- appositives, prepositional phrases, and subordinate clauses of various sorts. When every one of Cicero's words is accounted for, he goes on to the next period. Like diagramming sentences in a modern classroom, this method of analysis was repeated through many texts until it became second nature to the student. Thereafter it could be abandoned as a regular practice, but remained in mind as a fall back for approaching any difficult passage.</p>\n<p>Pellisson, then, was a very modern packager. He prescribed a clear method for using the books he authored or edited, and he provided step-by-step instructions for using other, classical texts in the early stages of teaching grammar. His descriptions of method are fuller and more systematic than those we have seen in other grammar books, and they also conform to the developing norms for advertising textbooks that we have encountered. As neatly packaged as a sixteenth-century textbook could be, Pellisson's Despauterian grammar was both a practical pedagogy and a marketable commodity. In this form -- but really only in this form -- our Northern grammarians had some success in the Italian market.

This fact is particularly clear when a given book has to cross an intellectual border and find a market in a foreign pedagogical environment. Even if the subject is identical on both sides of the border, and virtually timeless like Latin grammar, authors and publishers had to work certain cultural translations to make the import work. Geography offers other instances of cultural translation, though they are much more complex than simply moving from Brabant to France to Italy, changing typefaces, or advertising to a different public. Geography started the Renaissance as a literary pursuit, an armchair science, but already in the early sixteenth century it was also a practical discipline, based on data that did not even exist a hundred years earlier. Moreover, this new data was pouring in almost faster than the presses could report -- from Africa, India, and the New World, and from new celestial observatories. Textbooks lagged well behind the knowledge curve, at least in part because the scientists and explorers had to accomplish so many other exchanges and translations before authors could attempt elementary treatments. In this chapter, there is space only for a few examples of textbook or textbook-like treatments. We will discover more limitations than achievements, and even more barriers than Latin grammars faced.</p>\n<p>Literary geography derived from two traditions. First there were ancient and medieval travel narratives that had entertained Europeans for centuries. Secondly, an impressive but relatively recent humanist, philological tradition was devoted to deciphering place names in classical literature and providing geographical information in glosses to the ancient texts. (60) Only in the sixteenth century did anything like a basic geography textbook appear, and then only because writers began to see the subject as a practical discipline with information to absorb and skills to master -- a how-to genre -- rather than a primarily literary form. To the degree that geography remained proto-scientific, moreover, it was often treated in Latin and not in the vernacular. While many travel narratives were written in Italian, most geography textbooks were still composed in Latin up to the end of the sixteenth century. Only the most successful were translated.</p>\n<p>Writing about travel was an important early Renaissance genre. No less a humanist celebrity than Petrarch provided a model with his guidebook to the Holy Land, in Latin, compiled entirely from literary sources for the use of a friend who would travel there. (Petrarch himself never did, and probably never even wanted to.) In content it is fairly traditional, recounting an itinerary in some detail but without reference to broader geographical context. Other writers of the fourteenth and fifteenth century also offered itineraries.

This 1152-line poem starts with a general introduction to the shape of the cosmos. Later sections treat of the climates and seasons, navigation, and the continents and seas. It was the first vernacular text to offer such lore to a non-Latin audience, and it was widely popular. More than two hundred manuscripts survive and eighteen editions appeared up to 1543. The poetry itself and the contents of the surviving manuscripts suggest that the public for the piece was not humanistically trained. Dati's were readers of the merchant classes, comfortable reading Tuscan but not Latin. (62) To modern eyes, the work reads very much like a textbook. The competent but unpretentious <em>ottava rima</em> verses reinforce this sense, since texts to be memorized by students were regularly versified. Many manuscripts are richly illustrated with diagrams and maps in text, another didactic strategy that relates the <em>Sfera</em> to more scientific texts of the early Renaissance. Although it does not fit any known school curriculum, Dati's <em>Sfera</em> does fall into a category we might call moral-didactic. It is a reminder that how-to books did not limit themselves to actually making or doing things; they also set out to teach people how to live well and virtuously in a geographically defined real world.

Pellisson really did package a better De Spauter, more compact and easier for teachers and students to use. Pellisson omitted a few of De Spauter's verses and rearranged others, but he achieved his abbreviation primarily by reducing the explanatory notes by as much as two thirds. Printers in Paris, Lyon, and later Venice forwarded this project by preserving the clarity of De Spauter's typographically accented verses and sometimes improving upon them. In Italy, the couplets De Spauter intended his students to memorize were typically presented in a large roman or italic type and followed by explanatory material in smaller type, often contrasting italic to roman. (52) Alternatively, contrast was achieved by using two similarly sized types, a roman for the verses set off with spaces above and below, and italic in the same size set into tight blocks. (53)</p>\n<p>When presented in the typical Italian quarto or octavo page, these typographical arrangements could be quite pretty, and they were practical. A given rule could be located easily, even when referring to the book casually. When a class worked through the text in order, the students could easily see which parts of the next lesson they would be expected to memorize. These formats did not foresee (and did not allow for) much if any additional annotation, but the <em>Contextus</em> together with the <em>Rudimenta</em> offered a fairly complete set of rules and enough examples to get the student started reading serious literary texts, all in a compact package. As Pellisson made clear in the introduction, he omitted De Spauter's lengthy notes and examples because he expected extensive vocabulary study to be undertaken when Terence and Cicero were read, not as an independent drill.</p>\n<p>The late sixteenth-century package in which Italian schoolboys would most likely have met our Northern grammarians was a small octavo volume simply bound in paper or parchment. The book they owned either combined the <em>Contextus</em> of De Spauter/Pellisson and the <em>Rudimenta</em> of Pellisson behind one title page, or else it presented the two works as matching booklets bound together but with separate title pages and page numbering. A particularly handsome example of this second form is the graceful pair of octavos printed by Antonio Bellone at Genoa in 1563 and 1566. (54) Both booklets are presented as the work of Pellisson. The title page of the <em>Contextus</em> referred to De Spauter merely as the inspiration for this kind of grammar (\"œDespauterian\") and the preface, as we have already noted, provided a back story of sorts, in which De Spauter did not finish the work of writing the perfect textbook. (55) The two title pages might induce the student to see them as separate texts to master, but they occur together in one volume so regularly in modern collections that it seems likely that they were often if not almost always presented to students as a pair. Bellone followed a house style for these books, one that gave schoolbooks a decorous, humanist look. He arranged the text using types in two sizes and a relatively spacious layout, with the result that the <em>Contextus</em> runs to 268 pages and the <em>Rudimenta</em> to 164. Bound together the volume was substantial but not weighty, handsome but not pretentious. (56)</p>\n<p>When more tightly packaged behind a single title page, the student would purchase the two works together and consider them as one textbook. In these cases, the shorter and in some ways more basic <em>Rudimenta</em> always followed the <em>Contextus</em>. (This was the usual order in composite volumes with two title pages too.) Unless the instructor made a point of it, the student might even overlook the fact that there were two works in his textbook. The order was no doubt dictated by the way in which the package was used. The Despauterian method emphasized the memorization of verse rules and the <em>Contextus</em> proceeded in this fashion. Some masters may have wanted to use only the Despauterian method and so for them the <em>Rudimenta</em> was a mere add-on, useful for reference but not drilled. Pellisson probably understood the exercises in the <em>Rudimenta</em> in this way too; its rules in prose could be dipped into as needed when drilling the canonical Despauterian doggerel.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/4.00_Chapter_Four/HFS_087.03.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/4.00_Chapter_Four/HFS_087.03.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Small book, space at a premium (click to enlarge - 981 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>A typical combined edition is that printed by Francesco Lorenzini at Venice in 1562. It is an altogether homelier and less spacious production than the Bellone editions. The types are tiny, the layout ungenerous, and the volume is foliated continuously through both works. The design is notable for its economy, not for its beauty. De Spauter's verses are set off on separate lines, centered on the page and presented in a small italic type. The indentations around them provide the only white space on the page except the narrow margins, for the remaining explanatory notes are set very tightly in a roman of the same size as the italic. At least one student reader marked his copy to make the verses he was required to memorize even easier to find on the crowded page; he framed some of the verse rules in ink but marked none of the prose passages. Clearly, his interest was not in the fine points; he merely wanted to get through the course.

The <em>Rudimenta</em> are introduced with a modest caption title at the top the next, verso page. Pellisson's preface to the <em>Rudimenta</em> is presented in full; and if the teacher made the students work through it they would have understood the point that this is a separate work. In fact prefatory letters were often read in class as examples of good prose, so it is not out of the question that the students were introduced to the personality and pedagogical principles of Pellisson this way. Lorenzini gave relatively generous space to the paraphrases of prayers that constituted Pellisson's first stage of learning.</p>\n<p>A great variety of packages were devised for Pellisson's Despauterian textbooks. In addition to the combined and separate editions that appeared at Venice from the 1560s onward, there was a distinct tradition of printing Pellisson in Piedmont -- at Ivrea, Turin, and MondovÃ¬ -- and at Genoa. These editions seem to have taken their starting point, not from Paris or Venice originals but from the editions that had come off the presses of Lyon in the fifteen thirties and forties. Piedmont was always more susceptible to direct influence from France than other Italian regions. It was a natural and nearby market for Lyon printers.</p>\n<p>A revision of the Despauterian grammar by the German humanist Sebastian Novimola (1500?-1579) was proposed in 1553 by the Venetian printing firm \"At the Sign of Hope.\" Novimola claimed to have corrected De Spauter's work using the author's own notes, to have revised the examples to make them more enjoyable and more conducive to good morals, and to have clarified the prose explanations of the verse rules. The Venetian printer took these pedagogical claims to heart and provided the text with a particularly clear if unlovely typographical dress. This publisher not infrequently imported texts from the suspiciously Protestant north, and this version of De Spauter included several references to Erasmus which at least one Jesuit censor carefully blotted out. (58)</p>\n<p>Still another version of the <em>Contextus</em> with <em>Rudimenta</em> specialized for the Italian market appeared at Venice in 1568 from the press of Giorgio Cavalli. It is characterized on the title page as \"now also enlarged and explained in many places in the Italian language.\" This practice reverted to that of De Spauter's early publishers, who had provided vernacular equivalents (in Dutch or French) in some of his original textbooks. Most Italian editions preserved Pellisson's intermediate work, which had deliberately dispensed with vernacular aids to consultation.

In his brief prefatory letter to the <em>Contextus</em>, addressed to a fellow school teacher, Pellisson proclaimed that De Spauter had invented a highly productive method for teaching. The printed versions of De Spauter's grammars, however, were prolix and difficult for students to digest. Hence the need Pellisson felt for a simpler version. Pellisson was anxious to seem to be De Spauter's devoted follower, even his heir. So he insisted in this preface that if De Spauter had lived longer, he would have undertaken an abbreviation just like this one. This was cunning advertising, and successful too, for Pellisson's <em>Contextus</em> became the standard Despauterian grammar in Italy.</p>\n<p>As a coda to his preface, Pellisson complained of the continuing popularity of the barbarous verse grammar of Alexander of Villa Dei, the <em>Doctrinale</em>. He was repeating De Spauter who had decried Alexander in detail in his own prefaces and also within his grammar books. (50) For Pellisson, this commonplace lament served primarily to consolidate the reputation of De Spauter as the greatest modern grammar master. Contemporary teachers sometimes denigrated De Spauter, he wrote, but only because they were servile followers of Alexander. In this preface, Pellisson was working hard both to attach himself to De Spauter's reputation and also to belittle the opinions of enemies the Flemish master had made. He did not for a minute adopt the conciliatory tone of Josse Bade, nor did he accept Bade's notion that the <em>Doctrinale</em> could still be useful. The popularity of the <em>Contextus</em> in Italy after 1560 may have something to do with the fact that by then the controversies over De Spauter's negative opinions of other grammarians had died down. Mancinelli in 1500, as we noted in sections 3.10 and 3.11), was attacked as insufficiently devoted to the memory of Valla. But by 1560 neither Pellisson nor De Spauter were alive to cause further scandal and there were few Italian scholars or school masters who felt it was necessary to defend Valla (or Calepino, or other Italian masters) against all comers. Alexander, too, was largely out of use in Italian schools in this period, but the attack on the <em>Doctrinale</em> was a commonplace that might still resonate as advertising an author's humanist <em>bona fides</em>.</p>\n<p>Patterns of annotation also give us some clues as to the manner in which Pellisson's De Spauter was used in Italian classrooms. As with most textbooks, the most frequent kinds of annotations are indexing marks, aimed either at identifying specific contents for a subsequent use of the text or else at clarifying the typographical cues as to content already present on the printed page. The Italian annotator of a 1541 Lyon edition was typical. He began by clarifying the layout, marking each \"rule\" and \"exception\" as such in the margin. After forty pages of such notes, however, he changed his strategy and started to make true subject-index notes, either by underlining the index term and putting <em>Nota</em> in the margin or by transcribing the term itself. His indexing is completely systematic for certain parts of the course (nouns and irregular verbs) and thin or absent for others (regular verbs, figures of speech, prosody), indicating that he had different levels of need for indexing. The <em>Rudimenta</em> bound together in this volume is not indexed at all. Perhaps its layout (with clear chapter heads to serve as subject guides) suggested that annotation was unnecessary. Even more likely, the <em>Rudimenta</em> in this copy was never used at all, since it is not only unmarked but generally fresh and little thumbed. (51) This copy of the <em>Contextus</em>, at least, was well and thoroughly used by a serious student or teacher of elementary grammar who largely ignored the shorter grammar of Pellisson.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(50) Ford 2000, 163-166; Jensen 1996b, 36.</li>\n<li>(51) Pellisson 1541a and 1541b bound together, copy at the Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Although Pellisson never made a direct address to his Italian audience, we may attempt a late-century Italian reading of his earlier prefaces.

The implication is clear. The ideal humanist needed a basic familiarity with geographical concepts and he had to understand the proper meanings of place names.

Dati's scribes squeezed the maps into the margins, where they diligently illustrated coastlines and offered tiny city views of major ports. This kind of illustrated poem defies modern logic, both pedagogical and cartographic. Like the cosmological, \"textbook\" portion of the poem, it seems to have been intended as a mnemonic for the use of merchants, diplomats, or other voyagers to Mediterranean destinations. But it surely was not used by the sailors who were in charge of actually getting there. Both the descriptions and the maps are good enough to appeal to a literate traveler (either the real or armchair version) but not precise enough for navigators.

Printed editions of Dati's work, in fact, omitted the maps and simplified the diagrams, suggesting that by the end of the fifteenth century the <em>Sfera</em> was no longer considered an instructional poem but merely a literary recreation. Editions of 1503 and 1518 bear a title that emphasizes this aspect of the poem, <em>In this book is contained the power of the planets that govern the world, which book is called The Sphere</em>. Certainly Dati's work was out of date. As geography, it could not bear the weight of its own elaborate illustrations. Later authors of itinerary-based geographies, however, took full advantage of the technical possibilities of printing to include the most up-to-date information in text and in maps. Italians came to call such travel-based geographies <em>isolari</em> or island-books, since the reader/traveler proceeded from port to port with stops at islands or other destinations not joined to Europe or Asia by land passages. This genre, with its somewhat misleading name, would survive into the sixteenth century and beyond. <em>Isolari</em> became ever more factual because their authors were increasingly informed by the European reconnaissance of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. But the form remained that of a guidebook and not a textbook. Thus, across a period of over two hundred years, Cristoforo Buondelmonte (writing about 1420), Benedetto Bordone (1450-1530), Tommaso Porcacchi (ca 1530-1585), and Vincenzo Coronelli (1650-1718) used the idea of an island-collection to organize compilations of geographical knowledge intended for non-professionals.

He framed them rhetorically by saying that his was a work of topography devoted to the Mediterranean world, adding that topography is part of the larger discipline called Astrology. This science is founded on Arithmetic, Geometry, and Music and its parts are Cosmography, Geography, Chorography, and Topography. Topography for Bordone was a narrative form, following a journey, and as such it was the most literary of the many parts of Astrology. Thus framed, it was possible for Bordone to include all sorts of information, some of it highly miscellaneous, and to update the book as needed. In several later editions, he and his publishers made minor additions to the general factual content, and for the second edition (1534) they even included a bit of exciting geographical news, the conquest of Peru.

At the elementary level, it was no longer enough to conceive the world in purely European and Christian terms. Not incidentally, several of the most important general geographies of the period were penned by schoolmasters who also taught Latin grammar and rhetoric. Their polymathy made them more open than their contemporaries to including new geographical data.</p>\n<p>Joachim Vadianus (1484-1551) at St. Gall in Switzerland and Johannes Honter (1498-1549) at BraÅŸov (Kronstadt) in Transylvania were true polymaths. They taught school, took part in local politics, and edited or composed texts on grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, and science. Both men knew the latest books by Italian humanist authors but did not rest content with Italian humanism. Vadianus was also a medical doctor and poet; while Honter closely supervised the cutting of woodblocks for the highly accomplished maps that appeared in is works. Both were educational reformers on the local level and prominent internationally in Protestant Reform circles, feeling as they did that humanism was an appropriate vehicle for the new evangelical ideals.

First published in prose (1530) and then recast in Latin hexameters (dating from 1541), the <em>Rudimenta</em> saw over a hundred editions. But it was published only twice in Italy, both times discretely buried inside larger works by other authors. Composed for use as a textbook, its only Italian editions were inside enormous encyclopedias. Interestingly, in this same form three editions in Italian were published at Basel and Cologne, presumably for Italians resident in Switzerland and Germany. (73)</p>\n<p>Vadianus' <em>Summary of the Three Parts of the Earth</em> (<em>Epitome trium terrae partium</em>, first published in 1534) was similarly successful, but again, not in Italy. Vadianus developed this comprehensive geographical manual (most editions run to five hundred pages or more) by building on earlier scholarly and evangelical publications, respectively a commentary on Pomponius Mela and a study of the missionary voyages of St. Paul. Vadianus presented the <em>Epitome</em> as a logical outgrowth of Scripture study. He offered his readers no less eminent a mentor than St. Paul, whose missionary travels were a commonplace model for modern evangelicals. Vadianus claimed that Paul's letters are best understood by those who study geography so as to know about the peoples and physical features of foreign lands. Geography and the missionary impulse were thus inextricably linked in Vadianus' influential work. (74)</p>\n<p>Both Honter and Vadianus employed printers who knew how to make books in the latest humanist styles. Indeed, most editions of Honter's little geography would have been at home, graphically at least, in any Italian bookshop of the fifteen forties that catered to Latin-school students. The first edition of the <em>Rudimenta</em> in verse, printed at BraÅŸov / Kronstadt under Honter's direct supervision, is an octavo with the poetic text set in italics, in the style of the popular Aldines of the period. The paper and presswork are first quality. The title page is adorned with a simple architectural border, not an Aldine look but still consistent with many books printed at Venice for the Hungarian and Balkan market. Later editions by Christoph Froschauer in Zurich are even more Venetian in look.

The <em>Epitome</em> was much longer than the <em>Rudimenta</em>, and it usually came off the presses as a chunky octavo. In Basel and Zurich editions (the latter also by Froschauer), its prose text is less spacious on the page than Honter's hexameters, but the types are clear and well used, and the result was a book very much in tradition of Venetian scholarly octavos of the period.

Almost every Latin textbook we have examined thus far trumpeted its contribution to this goal, and many were offered up as direct substitutes for specific, older grammar books. Renaissance grammar masters realized as well that the ancient grammars (both introductory and advanced) offered little guidance to the intricacies of Latin syntax. In particular there were no ancient grammars that treated subordinate clauses. Medieval grammars did address syntax extensively, but were hopelessly marred by \"barbaric\" medieval examples and mired in explanations that derived from scholastic categories of analysis. (1) Lorenzo Valla had offered a thorough critique of the results of this kind of education in his <em>Elegantiae</em>, but the many careful distinctions of usage he recorded there were not well adapted for classroom use. Soon an entire genre of textbook derived from the <em>Elegantiae</em> grew up. These epitomes or digests of correct usage offered students thoughtfully defined vocabulary words with concrete examples of idiomatic usage drawn from classical sources. Such usage manuals, however, were mere lists; they did not provide thorough rules. (2)</p>\n<p>Given the lack of systematic guides to syntax, it is no surprise that the largest number of entirely new fifteenth and sixteenth-century grammar books concerned \"construction\" (that is, syntactical relationships). The grammars that achieved the greatest success were those that offered teachers ready answers in this field. Much of the appeal of the excruciatingly detailed grammar of Jan de Spauter, for example, may be attributed to its value to teachers as a guide to explaining the complex syntax of authors they would likely read in class with their students. South of the Alps, writers like Perotti, Mancinelli, and Sulpizio had addressed the same problem, attempting to devise an adequate explanatory vocabulary for syntactical relationships based exclusively on classical examples. Progress was slow and most writers continued to borrow explanatory terms from medieval authors. (3) The systematic grammars attempted in the fifteen twenties and thirties incorporated lessons on syntax derived both from the epitome tradition and from earlier humanist manuals on syntax. As we have seen in earlier chapters, some of these textbooks achieved considerable local success and became entrenched in the schools of particular towns or regions. A few were sold in more than one regional market. (4)</p>\n<p>Before 1570, however, we cannot point to any textbook that was consistently used throughout Italy. The closest contenders were Perotti, used widely in Italy and France, (5) and De Spauter, whose <em>Grammaticae Institutionis libri septem</em> as edited by Josse Bade was used extensively in France and the Low Countries and spottily elsewhere. Versions of it (usually partial) also found ready, local markets in Italy after 1550. Also frequently printed was the introductory grammar of Aldo Manuzio, an important case studied by Kristian Jensen. Interestingly, more editions</p>\n<p>Even with perennial favorites like De Spauter and Aldo, then, there is little evidence that systematic marketing of elementary and intermediate textbooks extended beyond a few major urban markets; and only Venice had a major export trade. The best marketing of the period failed to forward broad curricular reform. The limited market success, moreover, reflected teachers' continuing dissatisfaction with the quality of the textbooks available. This situation would change radically with the advent of the Jesuit colleges and later, schools of other religious orders.

Once textbooks in Latin had proven their utility in the classroom, they were sometimes translated, digested, or popularized for broader, non-Latin-reading audiences. Obviously, it was easier to accomplish such work of popularization when the starting point was an elementary textbook than when the source was an academic treatise. The new vernacular products were market-ready and, in a sense, market-tested, because they had already proved useful for beginning students. At the point of translation, however, such popular-level books also begin to seem (to us certainly, and perhaps also to their intended audiences) more like how-to books than textbooks. They were no longer part of a Latin-school curriculum, and they served useful and recreational purposes almost equally.</p>\n<p>In her influential <em>Le latin ou l'empire d'un signe</em> (1998), FranÃ§oise Waquet explained how the Latin language created an international cultural empire that predated the nation state and continued to exist as a Europe-wide ideal into the twentieth century. Our study of Latin grammars and elementary geography books suggests that the Empire of Latin also determined the way book markets functioned in the early modern period. Europeans invented printing at a crucial time, near the high-water mark of the humanist Latin program. Among philosophers and other scholars there was still hope for a unitary Europe, culturally if not politically. The market for high culture was as cosmopolitan and international as it would ever be, with all kinds of luxury goods and art (books and prints included) traded freely and frequently from the Balkans to the Baltic and the Irish Sea. Printers, like musicians and authors, were peripatetic. They followed the market for their services, whether the consumer was an individual patron, a church body, or the population of an entire city.</p>\n<p>The long sixteenth century, however, saw the rise of national monarchies and, not far behind, new national literatures and increased literacy in the vernaculars. Books, suddenly mass produced and plentiful, could not help but follow. Printers at first devoted by far the largest and most prestigious part of their work to books for international, learned audiences, and therefore in Latin. But printers also quickly discovered the value of local markets, even micro-markets like the students of a single school. We have seen how this localism functioned to limit the wide marketing even of Latin grammars. Local markets continued to exist for local Latin schools.</p>\n<p>In other fields, like geography, localisms also required the phenomenon we have called cultural translation, or, to use a different metaphor, the importation of ideas and information from the relatively borderless realm of Latin into other, smaller kingdoms. The change of language required other changes -- of format, type, or advertising pitch -- that were determined by the habits and preferences of readers on the local level. These changes were the effective minimum a book needed to cross the borders between one Latin market to another or to move from the Latin markets to vernacular ones. Sometimes, changes of genre followed. Versified geographies offer a particularly good example, one that bears more study. For, although the genre was popular, it is fairly clear that the authors envisioned several different audiences. Each work must be evaluated as to its intended readers; and, as in other genres we will explore in chapter six, the actual readers were sometimes not those envisioned by the author.</p>\n<p>Like political and language borders, moreover, the borders between book markets also had barriers. Import fees were a frequent source of complaint by booksellers. Religious differences and the consequent facts of censorship were equally problematic. In chapters five, six, and seven we will see that the authors of textbooks also exercised a considerable amount of self-censorship when they moved ideas from the homeland of Latin out to farther-flung, vernacular provinces.</p>","excerpt":"Geography as a school subject remained largely in the Latin realm, at least in the first instance.

He served as rector of the Jesuit college at Coimbra and as superior of Jesuit houses of study in Lisbon and Evora; but his first love was teaching grammar. In 1564 he was invited to send his classroom materials to Rome to be published, and the invitation was repeated with increasing urgency for some years afterwards. Alvares seems to have been a perfectionist unwilling to part with his text, and he only delivered it gradually across the early fifteen seventies. In the event the published versions were a great success, both on their own merits and also because they were named as the standard grammar for elementary schools in the international Jesuit <em>Order of Studies</em> (<em>Ratio Studiorum</em>) proposed in 1586. Alvares would become the most widely published Latin grammatical author for several centuries, with well over five hundred editions. (15)</p>\n<p>Alvares' teaching method and its presentation in print were rigorously systematic, one of the factors which most recommended it to the Jesuits themselves and to the wider market. Its three books (<em>Libri tres</em> in the formal title of the textbook) followed the standard division of the grammar course in the period: first morphology, then syntax, and finally prosody. Alvares divided each book into small sections and began each section with a concisely stated rule. He then gave a few brief examples and proceeded to clarifications or exceptions in what he labeled \"appendices,\" each with its own set of examples. For each rule these appendices proceed from simple to more complex. The examples included precise citations of classical authors which encouraged the student to think of the rules not as absolute or abstract, but as deriving from classical usage. In Book One on morphology, each of the brief rules is also followed by a few mnemonic verses, a practice held over from \"Despauterian\" pedagogy. In student editions of the grammar, the presentation then went on to the next rule. Parallel teacher's editions included an extensive commentary on each section and each appendix. These <em>explanationes</em> contain further examples, notes on irregularities, more exceptions to the rules, or discussions of the changing usage between Golden Age and later authors. (16)</p>\n<p>Alvares conceived of his text as one that would evolve. Fuller and corrected versions were envisioned from the start because Alvares knew that his fellow Jesuits would have strong opinions that would have to be taken into account. In the event there were several official revisions of the textbook. Moreover, the <em>Grammatica Emmanuelis</em>, as it was commonly designated, was published both as a long-form teacher's manual and in more compact student formats. Modern bibliographies and library catalogs do not distinguish between the various revisions of the text, nor between the two formats. Historians have further confused the issue by asserting that th</p>\n<p>These books present a bibliographical dilemma. Contemporaries rightly saw this highly successful Jesuit grammar as one important intellectual achievement. From our point of view it was one of the greatest publishing successes of the sixteenth century. But how are we to distinguish several, radically different versions of the \"same\" textbook? It is essential at the outset, therefore, to reconstruct the stages in the history of the text within the sixteenth century, both within Alvares' lifetime and in the first twenty-five years after his death. Its subsequent history (it was widely used until the late nineteenth century) will concern us only slightly.</p>\n<p>Alvares 's work proceeded far too slowly for the authorities in Rome, and so the second book, the <em>Syntaxis</em>, was sent to press in 1570, three years before Alvares finally (and apparently reluctantly) let go of the full three-book version of his grammar. We may conveniently divide the very early history of the text, therefore, into editions of the <em>Syntaxis</em> and editions of the <em>Libri Tres</em>, keeping in mind that the former continued to be published as a separate up to about 1580, well after it was entirely incorporated into the latter. After 1600, it was common to separate the <em>Libri Tres</em> again; Book I and Book II often appeared separately in the seventeenth century, as did a short epitome (really just a paradigm book) based on Book I. Later still, Book III appeared as a separate and the l</p>\n<p>Tension between Alvares and his superiors is evident in the early history of the text. (18) Out of deference for the author, the authorities in Rome gave him editorial supervision, but they were anxious to avoid further delays. Student and teacher versions of the <em>Syntaxis</em> appeared first at Venice, in 1570 and 1571 respectively. Alvares' direct participation in the editing probably seemed useful, and so the student and teacher versions of the full <em>Libri Tres</em> were first printed in 1572-1575 in Lisbon, where Alvares then worked. Almost as soon as copies arrived from Portugal, however, the new grammar was sent to press in Italy, so Rome and Venice editions appeared in 1573-1575 under supervision of the Italian Jesuits. In the late fifteen seventies and eighties, Venetian and Roman presses produced vast numbers of these standardized texts for the Jesuit colleges. The importance of standardization to the Jesuits may be judged from the fact that nearly all the teacher's editions are page-for- page and line-for-line reprints of the 1575 first Venetian edition.</p>\n<p>After Alvares' death in 1583, the locus of editorial activity on the grammar moved to Rome. The staff of the Collegio Romano worked a major revision of the student edition, concentrating on book two, the <em>Syntaxis</em>, which had proved unpopular with some teachers because it did not always use the terminology familiar to them from older grammars. This revision, in which the second book is characterized on the title page as \"recalled to the logic of the ancient grammarians,\" was published in 1584 at Rome and in 1585 at Venice. Some versions of this revision were styled \"recalled to clearer and more convenient logic.\" (19) As we will see, both these phrases implied better pedagogical practice, that is, the book was changed to conform to the way teachers actually presented the materials in question. (20)</p>\n<p>The Roman Jesuits also created a new <em>Epitome</em> or <em>Compendiolum</em> of Alvares for easier student use in 1589; and then immediately undertook yet another revision of the student text of the <em>Libri Tres</em>. This last edition included a title page that embraced the <em>Epitome</em> and so came to represent a new, unified assembly in which the original student text and a highly abbreviated, summary text were disseminated under one cover. This was an edition for students; their teachers would have a fuller, older teacher's edition to hand. The Roman editors filled out the volume by adding Aldo Manuzio's <em>Orthography</em> and Greek and Hebrew alphabets explicated by Paolo Manuzio. This revised and augmented student version was the basis of most of the later textbooks that went under Alvares' name.

The Jesuits established residential colleges (372 of them between 1548 and 1615) in almost every major provincial town. Their job was to train laymen of the elites and would-be clerics in Counter-Reformation piety and morals. They stressed the acquisition of Latin as an instrument of the universalizing mission of the Roman church -- in missionary work, in dogmatic and moral theology, and for the advancement of science. To this end, the Jesuits practiced what we today would call total-immersion language study. They forbade the use of vernaculars in class. They prescribed extensive oral drilling, poetic and oratorical competitions, making and reading emblems, and theater productions. They incorporated many achievements of humanist literary scholarship, offering Cicero as the best model for prose style, and Ovid, Horace and Virgil for poetry. Few of the Jesuits' methods were new, but they were highly successful in creating communities of young men from throughout Christendom, all sharing an easy command of spoken Latin and the religious vocabulary of a newly renewed Roman faith. (8)</p>\n<p>The first Jesuit college opened at Messina in Sicily in 1548. The curriculum was based on that of the early sixteenth-century humanist colleges of the University of Paris. This highly regulated Paris plan (<em>modus Parisiensis</em>) was conceived in direct opposition to the mishmash of existing curricula in Italy (what the Jesuits called a <em>modus Italicus</em>). It envisioned a sharp distinction between younger and older students. The younger pupils were to demonstrate complete mastery of classical Latin grammar, Latin composition, and rhetorical principles before they were permitted to go on to higher studies. Thereafter, students left classical studies behind and concentrated on philosophy, theology, modern languages, and other subjects appropriate to the needs of the Counter-Reformation church. For the Jesuits, then, Latin was a powerful instrument, but not the real point of education. This was not at all the traditional Italian humanist education, which had typically emphasized moral and practical instruction in which Latin language and literature were both the means and the end. As Codina Mir has noted, the Jesuits had to confront these traditional, classicizing expectations of Italian parents in every city where they established a new college. (9)</p>\n<p>The Jesuits were uniquely placed to create the teaching instrument humanist grammarians had been demanding for a century and more, that is, a fully systematic grammar entirely based on good classical models of usage. With an ever growing network of residential colleges, they created a demand for well-made textbooks. Even a single teacher's adoption of a given textbook had been able to ensure its local market success in the first age of printing. A prestigious, well-promoted teacher might also influence regional and national markets, as in the cases of Aldo Manuzio, Josse Bade, and Jan de Spauter. The Jesuits created a market on an international scale.</p>\n<p>It is a measure of educational conservatism as a universal impulse that even the Jesuits were slow to take advantage of their market-making powers, chiefly because they could not agree among themselves on the best textbooks. There were regional and national favorites, largely based on the expectations of the urban elites that dominated local markets. The earliest Jesuit-authored grammar was that of Annibal Codret, S.J. (1525-1599), composed in the late fifteen forties but only sporadically available and used mostly in the South of Italy and in France. It would later become popular in New France. (10) When in 1556 a verse grammar appeared, authored by AndrÃ© Des Fruex, S.J. (d. 1556) at the request of St. Ignatius himself, its publishers clearly expected that the whole order would come to adopt it. But they were deluded. It had only one Italian edition. (11) A more concerted effort to influence the teaching of the order was mounted by the Jesuit Collegio Romano in the fifteen sixties. They sponsored an introductory grammar by their own prefect, Diego de Ledesma, S.J. (1519-1575) which appeared simultaneously in Venice and Naples in 1569. Ledesma's supplementary <em>Syntaxis plenior</em> was issued by the same Venice and Naples printers that same year and at Turin the next. Ledesmo's textbooks, however, were never reprinted because they were quickly superseded by another official grammar, that of Manuel Alvares (1526-1583).(12)</p>\n<p>The period from 1550 to 1575, then, was one of intense experimentation with textbooks by the Jesuits. New rhetoric texts were authored and discarded with almost as much frequency as grammars, but the question of an elementary grammar was the most intensely debated one. Outside Italy and in some of the Jesuit colleges in the peninsula, the colleges tended to use the grammar of De Spauter or the Despauterian grammar of Pellisson which had been approved by St. Ignatius. It was briefly adopted even at the Collegio Romano in the early fifteen seventies \"until we shall have another composed by one of us.\" (13) In Spain, a grammar by Antonio de Nebrija (1444-1522) remained the local favorite. In Sardinia in this period, and perhaps also elsewhere, the Jesuits experimented with a grammar by the Spanish humanist AndrÃ©s Sempere (1510-1572). The catalogues of the Brera college in Milan and a miscellany from the Jesuit College at Loreto suggest that the teachers in these North Italian schools made use of many different grammar books. At various times at Loreto, for example, they apparently taught Jean Pellisson's <em>Rudimenta</em> in a Lyon edition of 1554, the 1556 Roman edition of AndrÃ© de Freux, a 1570 Venice edition of Guarino Veronese, and the 1572 De Spauter of the Collegio Romano. The Jesuits at Genoa owned copies of locally printed versions of De Spauter's <em>Contextus</em> and Pellisson's <em>Rudimenta</em>.

This four-page essay concerned the ill effects of permitting students and teachers to pronounce Latin according to the habits of their native vernaculars. Alvares rehearsed vowels, diphthongs, and consonants in turn, giving extensive, very detailed instructions to teachers at Rome on how to avoid corruptions of good Latin pronunciation deriving from the natural accents of their Italian students. Curiously, this warning on pronunciation was incorrectly labeled in the 1575 Venice teacher's edition, with the title <em>De nominum declinatione</em> (<em>On the Declension of Nouns</em>), which should be the heading of the first chapter after the preface. This error persisted through several Venetian reprints of the teacher's edition. The advice on pronunciation appears correctly labeled, <em>Admonitio auctoris</em> (<em>Advice of the Author</em>), in most student editions, but the title was corrected for the teachers only in 1585.</p>\n<p>After this 1575 warning on pronunciation, Alvares fell silent. In the years before his death in 1583 he turned his attention to other matters, and his grammar book took on a life of its own. New editions continued to carry his two or three prefaces. The Italian editions, all sponsored directly by the Collegio Romano, did not normally include additional prefatory material until after Alvares death.

The oddest of the sixteenth-century prefaces to Alvares' work is certainly that of the printer Guglielmo Facciotti, who reprinted the fully revised student version of the Collegio Romano at least three times in the fifteen nineties. He tells his readers that it would seem logical to print Book One of the Alvares grammar separately, \"since it contains the rudiments, as it were, of noun and verb inflections.\" Still, though he says this would be \"in every way more convenient,\" Facciotti did not in fact do so, and not by oversight, as he expressly says, \"because I know you, most humane reader, will not be ignorant of this fact.\" This is poor logic and worse advertising.

(30) It may be, then, that Facciotti was merely advocating a position some of the Collegio Romano faculty were already recommending. Certainly, the history of the text in the seventeenth century, especially outside Italy, is one of separate editions of one or two of the three books. For student use these were more convenient; and they allowed Jesuit college faculties to claim to be using Alvares in conformity with the <em>Ratio Studiorum</em> even when they were only using his texts for part of the course.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(29) During the review of the entire <em>Ratio Studiorum</em> initiated across the order in 1586, one Polish Jesuit was astounded to discover how much some northern European editions of Alvares published in the fifteen seventies differed from the Roman edition of 1584 that he had been asked to review; see MPSI 6:331</li>\n<li>(30) MPSI 6:320; 7:375-76.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Starting with the 1575 Venice teacher's editions , Italian editions of the Libri Tres also carried a third preface by Alvares, this one addressed specifically to teachers in Italy.

(22) Both privileges expressly granted exclusivity to Tramezzino and his family for the <em>Syntaxis</em> with or without commentary, referring to the teacher's and student editions respectively. We do not know how many times Tramezzino and his heirs printed the student version. A student edition licensed by Tramezzino to the Roman printer Vittorio Eliano (at the time regularly employed by the Jesuits in Rome) bears the date of 1572. The teacher's version was published by the family in 1571, 1574, 1577 and 1579. (23) Again, a 1577 printing at Rome was licensed to another printer, Giuseppe de Angelis. The Roman reprints evidence the effectiveness of the privilege of Paul V and the fact that the immediate market for the book was the Collegio Romano. The Venetian reprints prove that there was also a demand in some part of the market for a separate teacher's manual on syntax even after the appearance of the full <em>Libri Tres</em>. Although the new grammar was to be tested in the laboratory of the Collegio Romano, it was immediately useful well beyond that setting, something the Tramezzino family would have understood perfectly.</p>\n<p>The publication of the <em>Syntaxis</em> separately from the larger grammar book was part of Jesuit official policy to create and promote new textbooks. The choice of Tramezzino, however, was probably a business decision, based on his solid record as a publisher of other textbooks. The printer surely had an agenda slightly different from that of his Jesuit patrons. The Venetian privilege included not only the new work on syntax by Alvares but also an older grammar book of Jan de Spauter on morphology. An edition of this small portion of De Spauter's general introduction to noun and verb inflections came from the Tramezzino press in this same year as the first, student version of the Alvares <em>Syntaxis</em>, 1570. Eliano, the Roman printer who reprinted the <em>Syntaxis</em> in 1572, also printed the full De Spauter introductory textbook under Tramezzino's privilege that year, producing, that is, a book which exactly covers the mate</p>\n<p>There is no direct evidence for it, but the 1572 Rome reprint of the student version of the <em>Syntaxis</em> and De Spauter's manual of morphology in the same format may have been a limited order exclusively for the Collegio Romano. Alvares was at this exact moment prevaricating yet again about the delivery of his long-awaited comprehensive grammar, which was finally printed at Lisbon in late September 1572 in a student version. Twelve copies were shipped off to Rome in early October, and it was ready for an Italian edition only in 1573. The Roman Jesuits might have found themselves caught short in 1572, having exhausted the limited number of copies of the De Spauter/Alvares combination they had ordered in 1570 for what they had expected would be a short-term need until the new Alvares should appear. In this scenario, employing their regular printer Eliano at Rome would have provided textbooks needed for the 1572-1573 school year.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(22) For this practice and on Tramezzino: Nuovo 2002, 138.</li>\n<li>(23) On these editions, Tinto 1966, 84-88.</li>\n<li>(24) MPSI 4:243-244; Tinto 1966, 83-85.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Alvares and his printers left a sizable body of self-conscious reflection on the publication of the new grammar in the form of extensive preliminary matter, including several prefaces from Alvares' own pen.

The adoption of Alvares' grammar, though mandated for use in Jesuit schools from the mid-fifteen seventies, was in fact only gradual. The French Jesuits proved particularly resistant, but the earliest complaints came from Spain where the early editions were described as \"too prolix\" for easy use in the classroom. (31)</p>\n<p>For the reception of Alvares' work within the order we are blessed with a remarkable source, well explicated by Emilio Springhetti in a 1961 article and now fully published in the <em>Monumenta Paedagogica Societatis Iesu</em>. These are the critiques of the <em>Ratio Studiorum</em> of 1586 submitted across thirteen years by various provincial boards of experts. (32) The promulgation of the <em>Ratio</em> was already underway when the professors at the Collegio Romano published their first revised edition of Alvares, and the questionnaire that went to all of the provinces with the 1586 first draft of the <em>Ratio</em> was a referendum of sorts on the recent pedagogical reforms of the Collegio. The circular was apparently accompanied by copies of the new Alvares for comment. (33)</p>\n<p>Six Jesuit provinces had nothing in particular to remark on the matter of Alvares' grammar, but twelve provincial committees specifically replied to the question, \"Whether Alvares should be retained.\" The Roman professors themselves differed on this point. Some opined that each province should be allowed to choose its own grammar textbook. Others agreed with the representatives of other Italian provinces, one German province, the Spanish, and the Portuguese, who all voted to retain Alvares as the exclusive text for the entire order. The Polish province submitted the opinions of four separate teachers, but reserved judgement until new editions should appear, since they preferred other textbooks in some ways but felt that, properly revised, Alvares' grammar could be useful. The three French provinces (Paris, Aquitaine, and Lyon), on the other hand, were adamant that De Spauter's grammar should be used instead. The \"Despauterius,\" they insisted, was already widely used in France; it had been approved by St. Ignatius himself and praised by many humanists; it was older, shorter, and better organized than Alvares. (34)</p>\n<p>The French Jesuit masters did their best to seem fair to Alvares but they argued strenuously for their own favorite and did not hesitate to split hairs in his favor. It was true that De Spauter was often obscure, they said, but this prompted greater classroom diligence by teachers! His terminology was more technical and less elegant than that of Alvares, by which they meant De Spauter used long-known, late-medieval terms of analysis and not the less familiar, classicizing ones of Alvares. What is more, students who had started on De Spauter would have to forget what they had learned and start over if a new text were introduced. (35) This last argument tells us that the real issue was simply conservatism. The French masters themselves had started their careers by memorizing De Spauter and they did not want to \"unlearn\" it. Educational conservatism sometimes consists of such inertia. Teachers and (just as often) parents want the children of today to learn the same lessons in the same ways that their elders had. Attachments to textbooks, especially books that were widely memorized, often took this form -- affection reinforced by inertia. There was also resistance to having to re-train teachers.</p>\n<p>The revisers of the 1586 <em>Ratio Studiorum</em> also asked whether the present \"order of Alvares should go unchanged,\" a reference to the revisions proposed by the Collegio Romano in their Alvares editions of the mid-fifteen eighties. As a rule, the provinces in favor of retaining Alvares preferred to stick with the familiar textbook of the fifteen seventies. The Germans, for example, protested that Manuel Alvares had already, before his death in 1583, received and accepted a variety of criticisms, taking particular account of the suggestions of his most learned colleagues. They argued that the entire order should have just one set of textbooks. Alvares' work should remain as he had left it; this was essential to its authority and was the only way to restrain a natural tendency to tinker with textbooks. (36) This remark is telling, displaying as it does an uncharacteristically self-conscious understanding that, for all their natural conservatism, teachers also had an uncontrollable urge to innovate in the classroom, or at the very least to fiddle with textbooks. The authority of a textbook consisted not only in the strong reputation of it author but also in its durability, which could be ensured only by the sanction of a body of teachers determined to resist significant changes. The Germans may well have been criticizing the Collegio Romano with these remarks, since it was the Roman Jesuits who continued to tinker with Alvares. Their constant revisions, moreover, produced a continuing need to print new textbooks and made it harder to use older ones.</p>\n<p>Lastly, almost all of the respondents to the questionnaire about the <em>Ratio Studiorum</em> agreed that the verses used in the morphology section should be retained and that similar mnemonics would be useful for the other parts of the grammar. This recommendation seems to have been a reaction against the Roman editors' removal of the mnemonic verses in Book One in 1584 while seconding a revision that had been worked by the same Roman editors for Book Three on prosody. As a result, the original mnemonics for Book One were restored and new ones for Book Three were devised by the Portuguese Jesuit, Antonio VelÃªs (1547-1609).

The majority opinion won the day, namely that Alvares' grammar was a masterpiece, too good to discard. The new <em>Ratio</em> prescribed its continued use. But this victory on paper did not mean that all Jesuits immediately or even eventually adopted the Alvares grammar for everyday teaching. The teacher's edition would appear in almost every Jesuit college library, but the student versions did not necessarily end up in every student's hand. For example, Alvares' grammar was widely adopted in Portugal; but Spanish Jesuits continued to prefer a national favorite, the grammar of Nebrija. In France, the revised Roman version of Alvares was printed fifteen times in the sixteenth century, but it is unclear how widely it was used in classrooms. Many French Jesuits continued to prefer De Spauter. As late as 1664, for example, we find a detailed curriculum from the Jesuit colleges at Albi and Mauriac that prescribes De Spauter for all three levels of the grammar course. (38) In New France, both De Spauter and the earlier Jesuit grammar by Codret were in use in the seventeenth century. (39) In Belgium and Germany, there was some resistance early on. (De Spauter, after all, was a Flemming, a native son.) But most of the Jesuit colleges east of the Rhine had adopted the Alvares grammar by 1620. Its real triumph, however, came in Italy, where under the influence of the Collegio Romano it was adopted almost universally and came to be used in many non-Jesuit schools as well.

The choice of typefaces (attractive new romans and italics) seems likely to have been left to the printers at Rome, Francesco Zanetti in the first instance (1584), but soon also Vincenzo Accolti (1585) and Bartolomeo Grassi (1585 and 1586). It is probable, however, that the editors had a direct hand in reformatting the quotations. Alvares favored including many examples with specific citations. This meant that most of the early student editions in octavo had cluttered pages, particularly in the so-called \"appendices\" to each rule where short quotations jostle in solid paragraphs with authors, abbreviated titles, and chapter numbers. The Roman editors and printers attempted to make this clearer typographically. They left the quoted examples inside solid-set paragraphs but removed the highly abbreviated citations to the margins where they appear in clear but tiny type.</p>\n<p>Questions of typography were definitely on the minds of the Roman editors, as they had been for others who were using the student versions of Alvares in classrooms. A fascinating survival from the Collegio Romano gives direct evidence of this process exactly in the period when the most extensive revisions were in progress. A copy of a 1583 Lisbon student edition with the <em>ex libris</em> of the Collegio Romano contains extensive notes about typographical revisions in the hand of a Portuguese reviewer. How this copy came to Rome we do not know, but it is clear evidence of the kinds of changes that were being contemplated there. The annotator marked numerous typographical errors including several passages that should be in italic and not roman type and vice versa. He would seem to have been working from another edition, since he supplied missing lines in poetic examples, rewrote passages that were confused, and added entire paragraphs omitted by the typesetter. In one case he directed that the quotations in a set of examples be rearranged into a clearer order. The largest number of changes concern the accuracy and arrangement of such classical examples: corrections to citations, corrections to the texts, additions of quotations, or substitutions of one quotation for another. More rarely, examples were deleted. These editorial interventions do not correspond to the changes made in any surviving edition I have seen, but they are consistent with the kind of work the Roman editors did in the early fifteen eighties. (46)</p>\n<p>Even with the extensive revisions undertaken in the fifteen eighties, and after the still more extensive discussions and criticisms mandated between the 1586 draft of the <em>Ratio Studiorum</em> and its 1599 promulgation, some confusion persisted about the order in which Alvares was to be taught. The 1599 <em>Ratio</em> recognizes this explicitly. The first of three classes of students was to study Book I and the first few sections of Book II. The second class would cover the next part of Book II up to the section of figured constructions together with the \"easier appendices.\" The third class would finish Book II, study the remaining appendices, and undertake Book III. This required curriculum, then, follows the overall order of the revised Alvares, but, as in most of the earlier critiques, it recognizes that the appendices were too advanced for most students. It was necessary to reposition this sophisticated material later in the course.

To some degree, this just reproduced the catch-as-catch-can situation of teachers in the preceding period who could not find a good comprehensive textbook. In 1574 in Sardinia, for example, editions of the full <em>Libri Tres</em> were not yet available, and one teacher therefore recommended using the <em>Rudimenta</em> of Codret, \"supplemented for the genitives and past tense from the book of De Spauter,\" next the <em>Syntaxis</em> of Alvares, and finally the prosody manual of De Spauter. (41)</p>\n<p>This confusing situation would be corrected, the Jesuits had thought, when the new grammar \"by one of our own\" became available. But the new Alvares also had to be parceled out between classes. The 1578 curriculum rules for the province of Rome suggest that considerable confusion reigned. They offered two different ways of dividing the Alvares text between classes, depending how large the school was and how many graded classrooms were involved. One of the divisions follows the three books of the published grammar closely and without much comment. The other division envisions using the first few chapters of Book One in the first class; another group of chapters from Book One and the first chapters of Book Two in the next class; the last part of Book One and the middle part of Book Two in the third class; the remainder of Book Two and the \"appendices\" (special rules and exceptions to rules) in the fourth</p>\n<p>The most important revisions were those undertaken by the teachers in the Collegio Romano, originally with an eye to circulating them with the 1586 draft of the <em>Ratio Studiorum</em>. These are incorporated into Italian editions of the student text from 1584 forward. In general, the revisers found the erudition of the author an impediment to beginning students. Even the shorter student versions, they thought, were overloaded with examples and exceptions that could better be left to advanced grammar students. Indeed, the full account of Alvares's learning was best suited to advanced studies. Decisions about using such material in the classroom could be left to the discretion of teachers and to their sense of what individual students could usefully digest. That the text was actually used this way is clear from surviving copies in which teachers have added their own notes from additional reading. (43)</p>\n<p>The nature of the Collegio Romano revisions will be clearer if we examine a few examples, comparing the student versions of the fifteen seventies to those of the fifteen eighties. The Roman editors claimed on their 1584 title page to have concerned themselves particularly with Book Two, on syntax. Alvarez himself revised the rather abrupt beginning of the <em>Syntaxis</em>, which originally leapt right into a discussion of the necessary agreement of intransitive verbs with their subjects. His revision included a definition of syntax. In the later Roman editions, this introduction was further enlarged so that the student started not only with a basic notion of syntax but also the general precept that certain words within sentences must agree. This simple change made it possible to proceed from the understanding that the first principle of Latin syntax is agreement to specific rules for verbs and subjects, for nouns and modifying adjectives, for prepositions and antecedents, and so forth.</p>\n<p>While the rules in Book Two were enlarged and clarified throughout in this manner by the Roman editors, the numerous examples offered for each rule were typically left standing. Despite complaints from teachers that the text was overloaded with examples, the editors abbreviated only sporadically, and even then the process was selective and favored certain authors, above all Cicero. For example, concerning the agreement of relative pronouns with their antecedents, one rule in the fifteen seventies was illustrated by four passages from Cicero, one from Seneca, and another from Quintus Curtius Rufus. In the edition of 1588, the exemplary material for this rule has been reduced to three quotations from Cicero. It is significant that the Silver Age authors disappear, especially the obscure Curtius, who was not much read in Jesuit classrooms. Cicero is rarely slighted, however. The very next rule was originally adorned with three quotations from Cicero which grew to five in the later edition; while in a later section, still on relative pronouns, three Ciceronian passages increased to seven. In general, the tendency was to multiply the passages from Cicero and to reduce in importance or even eliminate other prose authors. (44)</p>\n<p>Book Two on syntax, then, was somewhat rearranged and the examples were revised. Changes to the other books were less systematic, perhaps also less urgent. In Book One on morphology, which rehearses the declensions and conjugations in a traditional order, the Roman revisers followed exactly the sequence of rules and examples prescribed by Alvares for the first editions. The Roman editors claimed that they had eliminated some of Alvares's mnemonic verses, which they in fact did, to the dismay of Jesuits elsewhere. More constructively, the editors added more vocabulary words in each section, some of which had appeared in earlier editions as marginal notes. (45) In Book Three on prosody, by contrast, the principal change made by the Roman editors was to supply new mnemonic verses. They did not explain why the verses seemed useful in the one case and not so in the other.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(41) MPSI 4:524.</li>\n<li>(42) MPSI 4:17-18.</li>\n<li>(43) See copies at the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Roma: 204.23.D.13 is the 1583 <em>Libri Tres</em> used at Rome with many additional classical examples; and 6.3.B.24 is a copy of the Venice 1570-71 <em>Syntaxis</em> with epigraphic notes on the flyleaves by Fra Tomaso Inglese, presumably an English Franciscan schoolmaster in Rome.</li>\n<li>(44) Comparison based on 1570 Venice fols. 2r-v and 1583 Lisbon, 85r-v, with 1588 Rome, pp. 173-174.</li>\n<li>(45) Compare Alvares 1588 Rome with Alvares 1583 Lisbon.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Many of the criticisms of Alvares, and most of the revisions therefore, were based on practical pedagogical concerns.

He may have been emboldened to do so by the fact that the Jesuits had closed their college in Verona and, indeed, had been expelled from the entire Venetian state after they supported the failed papal interdict of 1606-1607. The whole later period of Pescetti's career and especially the early decades of the seventeenth century were an age of intense anti-papal and anti-Jesuit sentiment in the Veneto, but we should not imagine that most of this feeling was irreligious or even anti-clerical. Instead, the Counter-Reformation had created a vigorous lay piety that often centered on local cults and local churches. Its mirror in the political realm was the cultural activism of urban lay elites and the local governments they dominated. In such a climate, even the performance of preachers was a matter for public, often political discussion. In 1607, concurrently with the closing of the Jesuit school at the time of the interdict, the city council actually took up one of the recommendations Pescetti had made in his 1592 <em>Oration</em>, setting up a municipal school board. The aim was to create municipal schools to take the part of the absent Jesuits in the service of true religion. The city fathers felt well rid of the Jesuits, but this did not mean that they wanted to encourage irreligion or, worse, Protestantism. (55)</p>\n<p>I have not been able to find a copy of Pescetti's 1609 pamphlet against Alvares (it probably ran to 32 pages), but the title, text, and colophon were completely reprinted in 1616 as part of a 500-page refutation of it published by a Jesuit teacher at the Collegio Romano, Sebastiano Berettari (1543-1622), writing under the pseudonym \"Jacobus Ã  Fossa.\" (56) This reprint claims to give Pescetti's text word for word and spelling error for spelling error. If it does so, Pescetti would seem to have prepared a set of notes intended to refute specific points in Alvares' grammar as a brief against its use in Verona. It may be that with the closing of the Jesuit college, it had been proposed for use in other schools. The notes Pescetti provides could be read merely as suggestions for revising or correcting a text in common use, but more likely they were intended as an argument against adopting it in local classrooms. Alvares's <em>Libri tres</em> had been printed frequently in Rome and Venice in the fifteen seventies and eighties; more locally sponsored and printed editions also appeared elsewhere in Italy. There were editions (of the student grammar) at Genoa in 1588 and at Padua in 1591, for example. The first Verona edition of Alvares was a student edition of the <em>De constructione</em> in 1578, apparently intended for the new Jesuit college at a moment when there were not enough copies of the <em>Libri tres</em> to supply the rapidly expanding schools of the order. The Jesuits at Verona commissioned a full teacher's edition in 1592, again, probably because reprints of the Venetian edition of 1575 were not still to be had. This was followed by a small booklet with Alvares's rules on prosody in 1593 and yet another full-dress teacher's edition in 1597. This publishing record implies a popularity at Verona that must have alarmed Pescetti, who saw many flaws in Alvares' grammatical terminology and teaching methods. After the closing of the Jesuit college at Verona, all these textbooks were presumably on the market and in the hands of alumni of the college. We may imagine some pressure on the part of booksellers and parents, among them influential people who had sent their sons to study with the Jesuits, to see these by-now standard grammar books put to use. (57)</p>\n<p>Pescetti's brief critique of Alvares survives only in the context of the extensive defense by the Jesuits, a fact which presents us with some interpretive problems. Clearly the original pamphlet was intended for a local audience. It could not have been widely influential. Pescetti probably only wanted to strike a small, anti-Jesuit blow in Verona, taking advantage of the fact that the order was temporarily banned. Many of his criticisms repeat those voiced earlier by teachers within the Jesuit order, though Pescetti cannot have had access to such internal documents. The Jesuits, however, saw Pescetti's as a challenge from outside the order, and almost surely viewed the small booklet as part of a larger anti-Jesuit campaign in the region. Someone at the Collegio Romano, whether Sebastiano Berettari alone or a group of his colleagues, decided to squelch what they derided as Pescetti's \"dust up.\" (They titled their refutation \"A Puff of Dust Against Manuel Alvares, S.J.\" -- <em>Efflatio pulveris adversus Emmanuelis Alvari e Societate Jesu</em>.) They meant both to say that Pescetti's critique was of little substance and to note that it was directed at Alvares (now dead) <em>and</em> at the Jesuits' broader program. That Berettari expended 530 pages on such a nominally trivial challenge is due in part to his fulsome invective style, but it also suggests that someone in the order took Pescetti's challenge seriously.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(55) Calò 1940, 83-90; Pirri 1959, 168-189; Rurale 1998, 220-225; Pavone 2000, 227-235; De Vivo 2001, 179-190.</li>\n<li>(56) BCJ 1:247; on the existence of the pamphlet, Gehl 2003, 445-458.</li>\n<li>(57) This is admittedly a speculative scenario; but we do know there was a secondary market for Alvares's texbook, as for other grammars, witness the Milan inventory of 1594 (Stevens 1992, 411-412) with three used copies of a \"Grammatica Manuello\" and one new copy.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"In 1609, ten years after the The Teacher and nearly twenty years after his utopian Oration, Pescetti decided to take on the Jesuits again, this time in the form of a highly specific pamphlet attacking the grammar book of Manuel Alvares.

It seems unlikely that the attack was motivated by the strengths or weaknesses of the grammar alone; rather, it represented a small part of a larger critique of the Jesuits' educational success at Verona at the expense of established teachers. Still it offers us a remarkably thorough critique of Alvares' successful book.</p>\n<p>The protagonist of this Veronese controversy was Orlando Pescetti (1556?-1624?), a school teacher of local reputation much engaged in academy affairs in the Veneto but little studied today. He published defenses of Tasso and Battista Guarini and a spirited essay on the correct use of letter Z in Tuscan. His only enduring contribution was to assemble two collections of Italian proverbs, one in Italian offered as a literary commonplace book and model of vernacular eloquence, and the other in Italian and Latin expressly for use in Latin classrooms. He taught school for many years and seems to have gradually acquired a conviction that presenting boys with vernacular models could help motivate their study of Latin. This stance probably developed from another, more consistent position he took in defense of Catholic lay piety. For Pescetti, as for many other teachers of the period, language study and religious education were deeply entwined. He was convinced that contemporary schools, whether municipal, private, or run by religious orders, too often failed in this primary mission. (49)</p>\n<p>The Jesuits had established a college at Verona in 1577 at the request of the local bishop, with the patronage of Carlo Borromeo, and with the permission of the city council, though this last did not come without considerable dissent. Pescetti was too young to have had a useful opinion at the time but he later sided with the dissenters, feeling as they did that the city should take responsibility for elementary education and supervise it closely. The Jesuits, of course, tolerated no such local interference. (50)</p>\n<p>Pescetti launched an opening salvo in his anti-Jesuit campaign in 1592 with the publication of a lengthy <em>Oration</em> on the reform of the grammar schools The piece was utopian, but presented as the fruit of long, practical experience and offered as a real proposal to a city official, Count Giulio Cesare Nogarola. (51) The oration develops in an interesting way, both logically and in terms of rhetorical strategies. Pescetti seems at first totally incapable of irony, even though both his rhetoric and his ideas are writ improbably large. He proposed a radical school reform aimed at making Verona over into a Platonic philosopher's realm where there are no idle or irreligious youths. Universal education, required of all able citizens (males only, of course), would create a common commitment to the Catholic faith, a common sense of civic purpose, and a new flowering of Veronese culture. Specifically, he recommended that the city fathers construct a single, central, enormous school (ten halls, each able to seat one hundred students), hire a corps of teachers based on merit examinations, and offer schooling to all comers A detailed curriculum is prescribed, appare</p>\n<p>Concurrently with establishing this great school, Pescetti continued, the city council should forbid all other instruction, whether by tutors or in schools. Teachers not on the central-school faculty would be banned from practicing in Veronese territory. This last provision would enforce the universality of the proposed schooling. It would ensure that poor but able students would have equal opportunity with the rich, and that aristocratic parents would not distract their children from the urban educational experience by taking them off to the country for long parts of the year. And it would put all non-certified teachers, including the Jesuits, out of business in Verona.</p>\n<p>Pescetti did eventually grow ironic. He pretended to imagine all possible objections to such a program, both on theoretical and practical grounds, and rebutted them point by point. He rejected all theoretical objections, claiming they are overridden by the religious and moral-educational value of his new program. Logistical matters he referred to the wisdom of the city fathers and to their proven ability to get things done. Practical opposition by the numerous existing teachers of grammar he dismissed by saying that those private teachers who were any good would compete successfully for places in the new school. He admitted that the Jesuits might be expected to object too, but, since the good fathers were always known to act in the common interest, surely they would see the value of the new school at Verona and acquiesce. They would take their own school elsewhere, where they were better needed, that is, to a place where the city authorities were not so diligent on behalf of civic education. Indeed, the Jesuits would have no <em>substantial</em> objections at all, so their opposition offered Pescetti, he said, the least concern of all the possible complaints.</p>\n<p>The subsequent stages in Pescetti's campaign against the Jesuits are obscure because he was largely unsuccessful until political events overtook the educational question; but he continued to be preoccupied by the presence of the Jesuit college at Verona through the fifteen nineties and into the next century. Perhaps needless to say, however, the city council never did create the school he envisioned, nor did they ban other schools. (53) Pescetti went on with his academic publishing. As far as we know, he also continued to teach in his own grammar school. He published a small booklet in 1599 entitled <em>The Teacher, or How Boys Should Be Taught, A Poem</em>. The 327 verses limp, but they offer a unique portrait of the ideal Counter-Reformation schoolmaster. This figure is decidedly not a Jesuit. Indeed the ideal teacher is a layman whose principal duty is to offer an example of lay piety and virtue. His first and most important subject was religion, his real goal to build moral character, religious fervor, and obedience to ecclesiastical authority. The Latin language and love of Latin eloquence were to be learned by \"singing Virgil,\" but Latin's principal value was in the service of the faith, both for inculcating Christian values and also as a discipline. Loose, ill-learned, and unregulated speech led directly to bad morals. The Latin teacher should concentrate on good authors and good examples of classical usage. He should employ Tuscan at every stage so as to improve the overall level of vernacular learning. Good students should able to complete such a course in three years.</p>\n<p>Although there was no direct mention of the Jesuits, this portrait of the pious lay schoolmaster implicitly criticized certain elements of their program, specifically residential colleges with long courses of study and the technique of Latin immersion to the exclusion of the vernacular in the classroom. More fundamentally, it opposed the Jesuit's highly instrumental view of Latin as a communicative technology devoid of intrinsic moral content. Pescetti spoke for a much older humanist ideal, that of Latin as a morally normative language. For over two centuries, humanists had defended their preoccupation with classical authors, subjects, and style by claiming (following medieval monastic models) that Latin was also tied intimately to the Christian faith and to the fully realized morality of the free, adult, male citizen. For the Jesuits, Latin was a skills course; morality and piety were learned in other forums.

No doubt, the Jesuits asserted, this poor school teacher was just trying to make a name for himself by criticizing the most learned grammarian of the age, \"our Alvares.\" In keeping with the overall satirical tone, Berettari characterized himself too. He was a short, greasy, hirsute provincial who serves as a teacher's aide at the Collegio Romano and who collected these refutations of Pescetti from among the waste paper that the elementary pupils were forever throwing onto the classroom floors.</p>\n<p>The full text of Pescetti's critique is provided on pages 31-64, exactly as it appeared in 1609 we are told, except that Pescetti's 170 criticisms (<em>reprehensiones</em>, a term that apparently came from Pescetti's title page) are numbered for easier cross-reference with the refutations that follow on 464 separately-numbered pages. Marginal citations to Alvares by chapter and title are also given. Though his voice is almost lost within the scurrilous literary frame, we can hear Pescetti reasonably well and judge the substance of his critique.</p>\n<p>Pescetti drew up his pamphlet on the basis of the short, student form of the Alvares grammar, exactly the one which was getting such wide distribution in the fifteen nineties. But Sebastiano Berettari mounted his defense of Alvares by explicitly citing the longer, teacher's edition by page and line number. He knew that this standardized version would be in the hands of Jesuit grammar masters throughout Europe, and by citing it, he tells us that his principal audience was the Jesuits themselves. There is a certain disjunction from the start between a public critique of one, student-level book and an in-house defense based on another, more scholarly text. The confusion is further exaggerated by the furious invective of the Jesuit author. He pulled Pescetti's notes apart, literally, into small morsels of criticism that could be pounded to dust under the weig</p>\n<p>A few examples will serve to show the nature of the original notes and the refutations. Pescetti made three kinds of <em>reprehensiones</em>. He complained about teaching practices embodied in Alvares' work, usually editorial and design elements that imply classroom practices to which he objected. More seriously, he took issue with the highly detailed grammatical analyses, a problem the Jesuits themselves had worried when they repeatedly complained that the text was too prolix for beginners. And occasionally, he disputed specific points of grammatical teaching. Consistently, however, Pescetti's remarks had to do with the classroom value of the book. He spoke as an experienced teacher with strong opinions about what works in the classroom. As such, Pescetti's notes may be the most thorough critique to survive of any single printed textbook of the period.</p>\n<p>It is striking, for example, to find specific exception taken to the layout of the conjugational paradigms: \"Since it is essential to teach boys the persons of the pronouns, and it is hardly possible to do so unless these precede the verbs which they modify, it is not a good idea to omit them in speaking [i.e. drilling].\" (58) This was a criticism of the formatting of the paradigms in student editions of Alvares, where the Latin verb forms were given without pronouns. The last phrase, though clumsy, suggests that Pescetti had drilling in mind. He wanted the students to drill by saying the Latin pronoun before each inflected verb and not without the pronouns, as would be the case if they followed the text of Alvares' book literally. Berettari, entirely typically, picked up first on the clumsy phrasing, complaining that Pescetti is a poor Latinist. On the substantive point, whether students should drill with the pronoun or not, Berettari was less clear, perhaps because he had both models in front of him in various editions of Alvares. He felt the need to defend what Pescetti criticized, however, so he said that including the pronoun detracts from recognizing the inflectional changes and that students would be better advised to concentrate on the markers for person embodied in the verb endings rather than on th</p>\n<p>Pescetti mounted a more sustained critique of Alvares's detailed rules and paradigms for imperatives. These occupy <em>reprehensiones</em> 10 through 23 as chopped up and numbered by Berettari. In fact the original probably criticized in one paragraph the whole schema by which Alvares described a number of different future senses of the imperative and imperative senses of the future. Alvares, for example, described a \"Command or Constitutional Mode\" (<em>modus mandativus, sive legitimus</em>) for verbs when precepts, laws and the like were stated either in the future or in the imperative. His example is <em>amato tu, uel amabis ...amato ille, uel amabit</em> which he translates with the single command form, \"thou shalt love ...he shall love.\" Pescetti complained laconically that \"these two forms, <em>amato</em> and <em>amabis</em> .... <em>amato</em> and <em>ama</em> are not equivalent.\" (59) He made similar observations for other of Alvares's terms that describe the various future senses of imperatives. Pescetti probably objected to the whole complicated series, which multiplied the terms to be learned and at the same time made imperatives and futures seem virtually equivalent. This is not a clear way to get usage across to students, he was saying. Berettari countered that Alvares knew perfectly well that the two forms are not the same and in fact provided additional rules and examples elsewhere in the book for the future without imperative force. On the face of it, of course, this defense actually proved Pescetti's basic point, that the grammar is too complicated for beginners. Berettari ignored this cavil and defended Alvares first on the technical, terminological point and then by multiplying the classical passages cited to support the concept. To do this, he had to cite the teacher's edition with its full apparatus, not the student edition Pescetti was criticizing. (60)</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Pescetti specifically objected not to faulty or overcomplicated pedagogical practice but to grammatical doctrine. <em>Reprehensio</em> 32 (again, Berrettari's numbering) concerned the \"potential mode.\" Pescetti simply said, \"The potential mode is a superfluous rule.\" (61) Pescetti did not say it is unhelpful in the classroom, merely that it is an unnecessary category of analysis because formally it is identical to the subjunctive. Berettari did not argue the theoretical point since he knew (as Pescetti did and as Alvares specifically said in the teacher's editions) that the term does not appear in the authoritative late ancient grammars which were Alvares' ostensible sources. Berettari merely claimed that it is a useful way to explicate some complex classical passages; and then he marshaled examples drawn from Alvares' teacher's manual.</p>\n<p>Repeatedly, then, Berettari's strategy was first to belittle Pescetti's learning (he even compares Pescetti to Alexander of Villa Dei, the ultimate humanist insult (62)), then to praise the erudition of Alvares, and finally to address the substantial criticism with whatever defense is to hand whether apposite or not. This pattern holds through much of the book. Obviously, neither Pescetti nor Berettari were giving a comprehensive or systematic account of the virtues of Alvares' grammar. Each had an agenda over and above that of discussing the book. Pescetti, ostensibly at least, was merely making notes of flaws observable. He wrote a book review, though with a clear intent to recommend against using the book in Verona classrooms. In the context of his long career, it is clear that he was also attacking the Jesuits more broadly. Pescetti concerned himself with the textbook as evidence of specific failures of Jesuit elementary education. For Berettari these arguments involved two distinct issues, first Alvares' authority as learned grammarian and with it the scholarly reputation of the Jesuits, and only then the utility of the standard textbook. The Jesuits were not about to give up the book, which was already a proven publishing success. Their defense was of their reputation as learned and effective teachers.</p>\n<p>Even more important than the fact that Pescetti should use Alvares' grammar to indict the order is the manner in which the Jesuits apparently concurred, or at least participated to the degree of publishing so furious and lengthy a defense. After their own long and sometimes unhappy experience with the Alvares grammar, the Jesuits were more than a little defensive of it. The Collegio Romano in particular had worked hard to secure the text from Alvares and had revised it repeatedly in the face of criticism from elsewhere within the order. The Jesuit teachers at Rome may even have welcomed the opportunity provided by Pescetti's pamphlet to solidify their claims on behalf of Alvares and to reframe its use as a defense of a Jesuit product against outside criticism. This new frame, born in the crisis of the Jesuit expulsion from the Veneto, might also have worked to mitigate lingering opposition within the order to using Alvares in Jesuit classrooms.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(58) Berettari 1616, 42: <em>Cum necesse sit pueros doceri cuius personae sunt pronomina, vixque, nisi, ea praecedant verborum personas dignoscant, non recte iubentur in loquendo omittere</em>.</li>\n<li>(59) Berettari 1616, 44.</li>\n<li>(60) Berettari 1616, 44-80.</li>\n<li>(61) Berettari 1616, 37: <em>Modi potentialis supervacanea prorsus est praeceptio</em>.</li>\n<li>(62) Berettari 1616, 106.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"No fewer than three prefaces to the Efflatio (thirty pages) made fun of Pescetti's learning and impugned his motives.

When the Barnabite and Somaschi fathers opened religious schools with humanities curricula toward the end of the sixteenth century, they at first adopted the standard Jesuit textbook. But by the second decade of the seventeenth century, they began to devise grammars, rhetoric manuals, and even arithmetic books better suited to the needs of their urban, non-residential schools. Most of these schools were made possible by bequests from civic-minded laymen. The municipalities that hosted them retained considerable control over the curricula and required that the fathers accept students from all ranks of society. They found Alvares' grammar too detailed for use in non-residential schools. (63)</p>\n<p>Alvares was explicitly and implicitly criticized by still other educators, especially in the Veneto and Lombardy, where anti-Jesuit feeling ran high through much of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century. In one curious Milanese example, even a writer who died long before Alvares wrote was made to criticize him. This is the case of Giovanni Alberto Bossi (ca. 1450-ca. 1518), a humanist priest at the court of Gian Galeazzo Sforza and his cultured wife Isabella d'Aragona. Bossi published an elementary grammar entitled <em>Epitoma, seu regulae constructionis</em> in 1503, about the time he retired from court to teach school in his home town of Busto Arsizio. It is a compilation from other, earlier works, but it clearly embodied Bossi's own take on what pedagogy should be. The book was printed a second time in 1521 and then apparently did not see print again until the age of the Jesuits. Its popularity was largely limited to the Lombard capital. It seems to have been proposed, then, as a local product on the local market, much as grammar books had always been published before the Jesuits made international marketing a norm. (64)</p>\n<p>Bossi's preface was generic enough to fit the market of 1566 (the third recorded edition) as easily as that of 1503. He complained that contemporary textbooks are either too long and detailed for beginners (he may have had Perotti's grammar in mind, but by 1566 the remark would have more naturally been taken to mean De Spauter's), or else ill-suited to teaching correct and beautiful usage (which describes the <em>Doctrinale</em> of Alexander of Villa Dei). His own plan was to produce something of middling length but fully correct. At fifty-six pages in print, he has clearly achieved the first goal.

Moirani spoke rather more directly to the market and teaching situation of the fifteen sixties. He lamented the lack of good Latin writing, ascribing it (in fairly conventional terms) to the venality and greed of teachers at all levels. Behind the conventional phases, however, we can discern a definite dissatisfaction with the educational institutions of the period, especially in Milan. He presented Bossi's grammar as one from the good old days, unjustly neglected by printers.

The most eloquent and direct criticisms to come down to us were penned by the humanist Aonio Paleario (1503-1570). Not coincidentally, Paleario was tried by the Inquisition. The charge against him was heresy, because he espoused several Protestant doctrines on matters of grace and free-will. But he was also a powerful critic of the church's educational practices. Paleario effected some reforms as superintendent of schools in Lucca in the fifteen forties and proposed even more sweeping ones in public orations during the fifties. (72) In 1557, Paleario's most important educational work appeared in Milan, <em>The Grammarian, or Rather, The False Conduct of Schools</em>. He was under warrant by the Inquisition when it was reprinted in Venice in 1567, along with a second work, a miscellany of essays on education that included a textbook-like anthology of grammatical rules, <em>Ideas for Learning Latin Grammar Together with the Usage of Cicero</em>. It is likely that his publishers sent these uncontroversial works to print in 1567 in the hope of saving Paleario's reputation (and his life). In the event he was executed in 1570.</p>\n<p>Like Bossi before him and Rubini and Pescetti afterwards but more radically than any of these others, Paleario's principal theme was that moral, linguistic, and scientific education should be an integrated whole. Teachers must learn to combine the science of things with the study of expressive means. The best model was Cicero, in whose political and philosophical writings Paleario saw an integrative power worth emulating. This was more than a humanist commonplace, for in Paleario's mind the political realities of sixteenth-century Italy included the corruption of the institutional church. The commonplace, then, had radical consequences institutionally and theologically. It was also radical when applied to the teaching of Latin. Bad Latin, Paleario insisted, results when it is studied merely instrumentally, for its own sake or as a tool. Latin will only be attractive to students and can only be beautiful when it is studied with immediate and constant reference to moral content and investigative contexts. (73) Like many earlier humanists, Paleario held that when rhetoric, science, and morality are one, language has the power to reform the individual and society. (74) This approach ran directly counter to the practices embodied in Alvares' textbook. The Jesuits also aimed at reforming society, but they hoped to do so with a high-powered, instrumentalizing, professional program of study. They separated off Latin as a discipline of total language mastery and taught other subjects in other courses in the Jesuit colleges. Their students, they thought, would become the leaders of a Roman Church reformed from the top down. Paleario's ideal students, like those of many other humanist pedagogues, were meant to be leaders of a Christian society renewed from the bottom up. No surprise, then, that Lucca, the city most profoundly influenced by Paleario's reform ideals, also resisted the establishment of a Jesuit college.

That of 1566 was designed to match the format of an old-fashioned Donat (that is, <em>Ianua</em> and Pseudo-Cato together with some other simple texts) edited in the same period by Moirani and published by the same printers, the Da Meda brothers. Moirani apparently intended the two textbooks to be used together, something we know happened in fact because some of the rare surviving copies are presently bound with contemporary editions of Pseudo-Donatus and Pseudo-Cato. (66) The 1566 edition of Bossi's <em>Institutiones</em>, apparently supervised directly by Moirani, presented the prefaces in a small roman type but the student text in a round gothic like those used for elementary textbooks early in the century. The Da Meda brothers were imitating the usage of Bossi's day; but Moirani may also have chosen to use this old-fashioned dress to distinguish his traditional authors from the modern ones then in use in Jesuit and other schools he disliked. In any case the date 1566 is suggestive, for the Jesuits had arrived in Milan in 1564 at the invitation of Carlo Borommeo to staff the diocesan seminary and found a college that would eventually become the great Brera institution, second only to the Collegio Romano in prestige. (67) A reprint in 1570 at Trino presented the same text in somewhat more modern typographical dress, roman types throughout. Milan would have been its logical market.</p>\n<p>Bossi's <em>Institutiones</em> got yet another life in print between 1589 and 1611, again in editions that were intended for classrooms in Milan, and which match Donats from the same printers. (68) These editions appeared at the height of anti-Jesuit sentiment in Lombardy and they were surely offered for the local market of non-Jesuit schools even though they merely repeat Moirani's text and contain no specific references to the Jesuits. Bossi and his companions, Pseudo-Donatus and Pseudo-Cato, now wear modern typographic dress, but of the sort common for the simplest and most elementary schoolbooks. The printers employed roman type throughout in a single size. But they clearly distinguish the rule books, <em>Ianua</em> and Bossi's <em>Institutiones</em>, from the Cato. The Cato is dressed with a clutter of red and black initials, head and tail pieces, and elaborate borders. Some of the printed marginalia are floral or composed of type ornaments; others display allegorical figures, cherubs, and garlands. In one edition we find a double-page spread with borders that depict female figures of Geometry and Arithmetic and a scholarly astrologer making celestial observations. By contrast, the printers gave little ornament to the rule books, just borders and red-and-black printing on the title pages. In one of the Bossi grammars, for example, the recto of the first leaf and verso of the last one are the only ones to use red-and-black printing, so that the resulting small-quarto booklet is drab inside but has a highly colored self-wrapper. Although the Donat was designed to go with the grammar of Bossi, the two little books could be (and probably most often were) given to school children as separate pamphlets sewn up but not necessarily bound more elaborately. The resulting products were diminutive and prettified in an old-fashioned way that must have seemed rather provincial in the age of Jesuit internationalism. We would call them down-market. By 1611, it might even be fair to think of them as medievalizing, since they reprise the look of fifteenth-century schoolbooks long after print conventions had moved on.</p>\n<p>Did this alternative textbook style also represent a critique of the Jesuit educational program? Certainly the makers and users of such books followed conservative, humanist models. A comparable pedagogical and design nostalgia may have suggested reprinting Antonio Mancinelli's <em>Regulae</em> and <em>Donatus melior</em> in similarly down-market booklets at Rome in just the same period. (69) Just as certainly, the sudden success of the Jesuits was before the eyes of the printers and schoolmasters who promoted these backward-looking revivals. In Milan it took the very concrete form of the enormous Brera college building under construction, while Roman schoolmasters could witness the pomp and pretensions of the Collegio Romano. Absent any explicit documentary evidence it is hard to assert that these little books represent a direct criticism of the Jesuits. But these books were certainly intended for non-Jesuit schools. Even when conservative teachers in such schools had nothing new to offer, they were resisting the novelties of the Jesuits, which were intimately tied in the popular mind both with the spirituality of the Counter-Reformation and with the centralizing institutions of the Roman church. (70)</p>\n<p>Still, conservative pedagogy claimed to be rooted in the Counter-Reformation too. Pescetti, remember, argued in 1592 for local control of lay teachers who would nonetheless be judged by their strict orthodoxy and dedication to teaching morals. At the same period Alessandro Rubini explicitly criticized Alvares's grammar as too difficult and implied further that the Jesuit had divorced teaching Latin from teaching morals. Rubini's corrective was to jettison the memorization of grammatical rules and classical examples altogether and substitute the reading of Christian maxims and proverbs. (71) These late-century authors were products of the Counter-Reformation but not enthusiasts for the Jesuits. Eighty years earlier, by contrast, Bossi had sounded only classicizing themes. He wrote before the Protestant Reformation began, and he complained of faulty pedagogical practices, not of the corruption of the church, teachers, or educational institutions. The prefaces of Bossi's editor Moirano, midway between Bossi and Pescetti or Rubini, are circumspect about institutions, but broadly critical of teachers for their venality, a charge long leveled at the clergy by laymen (and a subtext throughout Pescetti's anti-Jesuit writings). These lay critics were fully cognizant of the censorial power of the Counter-Reformation Church. They could complain of individual moral failures but not those of the institutions.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(66) E.g. the Brera copy: ++.V.28; fifteen years earlier Moirani had edited the <em>Carmen scholasticum</em> of Pilade for the same printers.</li>\n<li>(67) Scaduto 1964, 442-457; Bianchi 1995, 785-788; Rurale 1998, 115-143.</li>\n<li>(68) The Brera copy of Bossi 1611 is bound with a matching Donat: AB.XI.73; the pair also appears together in a shop inventory of 1592, Stevens and Gehl 1994, 55, 80 n. 79.</li>\n<li>(69) Mancinelli 1594a and 1594b, which match Pseudo-Donatus 1595 in format.</li>\n<li>(70) Pace Pescetti, there is little specific information on the curriculum choices of teachers in non-Jesuit schools at the period; but Morigia 1595, 182-184 gives a portrait of the rich variety of schools available to Milanese parents who chose not to send their children to the Brera.</li>\n<li>(71) Turchini 1996, 316; see also section 2.11.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"We may distinguish two versions of Moirani's Bossi.

Like the same author's basic music textbook (treated in a section 5.18), this seventy-page geography was designed for students in humanist schools. It covered terrestrial geography only and stuck very much to the basics because, as the author remarked in his preface, geography is one of the liberal arts, useful above all in the deliberations of citizens and as an ornament to public life. Despite this seemingly modest aim, Glareanus did not want his students to be mere dilettantes. His text was very much up-to-date with the state of geographical knowledge and technique. He included basic information about the newly explored lands of the Western Hemisphere; and he offered a clear and accurate description of mapmaking techniques. Glareanus advertised his work as briefer and more elementary than the important ancient sources for geography (he names Ptolemy, Strabo, and Proclus) and more accurate than other modern treatments. He claimed to have added information culled from other classical sources, among whom he named Pliny, Pomponius Mela, Macrobius, and Horace, a list that reminds us that humanist geography remained a literary pursuit even as it became more scientific.

When finally the first student editions of the complete <em>Libri tres</em> appeared in 1572-1573, the new textbook bore two prefaces, a half-page addressed \"to the reader,\" and a second, three-page preface without specific addressee. The first preface is very brief. It simply remarks that the student edition was \"almost naked of commentary ... without the multitude of scholia which might impede beginners.\" It was appearing before the fuller, scholarly grammar was ready. This preface is probably the basis for the assertion by some historians that the full version was the original and the student text an abbreviation, but in fact it evidences just the opposite fact, that Alvares already had a workable student text that he had used in his own classrooms. He was reluctant to publish it, however, because it incorporated the fruits of years of scholarly study without citing his sources in full.</p>\n<p>In most student editions the first, short preface is followed by two small poems by Alvares. These poems were probably explicated in class, because they also appear in the teacher's edition, usually after the second preface. The first poem was addressed \"to the book\" itself and invited criticism from any learned reader. This humanist commonplace would sit well with teachers of any sort. A second poem is addressed to the \"Christian teacher,\" and contains another conventional notion, that the first duty of the schoolmaster is to be a good moral model to his students. Only if the he joins the ornament of good Latin to true piety will the teacher be counted a success and attain salvation himself. This commonplace was a nod to the older tradition of teaching Latin as if it were in itself a moral discipline; but it embodied as well the more modern, Jesuit notion that morals are a study apart and that Latin is merely a tool of the learned man.</p>\n<p>The three-page, general preface that followed these preliminaries was self-justifying and also highly conventional, but, unlike most grammar book prefaces of the century, it was not boastful. Alvares assumed a modest, apologetic tone rather than an advertising one. He did not say that all previous books were woefully inadequate, merely that it was frustrating to discover that no existing book was so clearly superior to all the others as to justify its adoption in Jesuit schools around the world. This is a theme Alvares had been hearing from his superiors, that the order needed a grammar book of its own. He rephrased it with a simple, aphoristic account of Jesuit religious ideals. The Jesuit founders admonished all in the brotherhood to live in concord, agreeing among themselves in great matters as well as small. Even matters of apparently small moment, then, like the choice of an elementary grammar, should be made in common by all in the order. With this assertion Alvares recalled his brethren to the centrality of Latin study as part of their mission, what a conte</p>\n<p>Beyond these few observations on the genesis of the book, Alvares offered a brief account of his compiling method. He named his sources among ancient grammatical writers (a very thorough list of those known to the Renaissance) and then ticked off the literary authors he used for examples of pure Latin style. Not a single Renaissance grammarian or writer appears in this list, neither as source, authority, or stylistic model, not even Lorenzo Valla. (26) The omission of Valla, who had been an almost obligatory reference in grammar book prefaces for fully a century, is significant. Alvares's implied claims are two. First, the only sure way to imitate classical usage is to limit oneself strictly to classical sources. Secondly, hypercorrectness and the showy learnedness of most professional grammarians has no place in the elementary classroom. Perhaps Alvares wanted to avoid entering into contemporary scholarly controversies or giving potential critics the opening to do so. He surely thought it unwise to offer his bickering contemporaries as models to schoolchildren.</p>\n<p>The method of the remainder of the book is in perfect concord with this rigorist stance. Alvares provided a wealth of examples drawn from ancient authors and thus instructed his students from the start to use classical models. They were to see grammar as a descriptive discipline based on real but strictly classical usage. In this he followed the sense as well as the letter of the late antique grammarians, Priscian and Donatus, and he ignored much grammatical tradition. Matters of disagreement among Alvares's contemporaries were relegated to the commentary sections of the teacher's edition and even then were not attributed to modern authors, merely exemplified with quotations from the ancients. (27) Sometime between the first appearance of the <em>Syntaxis</em> in 1570 and its final incorporation into the teacher's editions of the <em>Libri Tres</em> in 1573 and 1575, Alvares also added a little exhortation to the beginning of his treatment of syntax which is the clearest single statement of his convictions about the descriptive nature of grammar. It may be a response to criticisms of the early editions of the <em>Syntaxis</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I would like to ask those who will read this book that they should not be annoyed that the rules of syntax are illustrated with so many examples, for this was not done by chance or causally, but with thought and consideration. For grammatical concepts are dry, trite, and insipid in and of themselves; and unless they be seasoned with the elegance and beauty of the ancient writers, uncultivated usage will in short order besmirch the Latin tongue with barbarities. (28)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even for beginners, then, it is essential to stay close to classical models, for studying rules can only be valuable if the learner keeps his goal, the beauty of ancient Latin, constantly in mind.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(25) Sebastiano Morales, S.J. in MPSI 4:347; 1998, 161-162.</li>\n<li>(26) Colombat 1999, 210-217.</li>\n<li>(27) Colombat 1993, 214-217 remarks that in this regard Alvares' claims to be an empiricist were disingenuous; in fact he depended heavily on De Spauter and Thomas Linacre (1450-1524).</li>\n<li>(28) Alvares 1575, 245: <em>etiam eos rogatos velim, qui hunc libellum sunt lecturi, ut ne aegre ferant, si Syntaxeos praecepta pluribus interdum illustrata exemplis offenderint; neque enim casu, aut temere, sed consulte, et cogitato id factum est.

The end of the sixteenth century was an age of experimentation both in printing and in pedagogy, and there were plenty of innovators who had concrete, practical contributions to try out on the textbook market. Some had no broad reformist ambitions but were simply unwilling to suffer the continuing dominance of traditional pedagogy. An earlier chapter described the reform of Latin pedagogy proposed by Francesco Priscianese in 1540. In Priscianese's textbooks the old habit of teaching Latin only in Latin was abandoned for a more pragmatic use of Tuscan to describe and drill Latin grammatical concepts. As part of his more radical reforms, Aonio Paleario took up this theme in the fifteen sixties; and Orlando Pescetti did so again in the nineties. They all insisted that both Latin and vernacular language mastery would be improved by this technique.</p>\n<p>Still other authors and publishers experimented with the physical design of textbooks intended to make pedagogy more flexible and less dependent on rote memory. As in the case of Moirano's version of Bossi, there is no explicit critique of the Jesuit program in these books, but they were clearly offered as alternatives to the triumphant march of Alvares's grammar. And they were marketed locally, in the fashion of fifteenth-or early sixteenth-century textbooks. One of the most radical authors in integrating pedagogy and design was Giovanni Battista Tebaldi (1535-1608) whose <em>Grammaticae Institutiones</em> appeared in Brescia in 1590 as a slim 72-page booklet. It is a basic treatment of noun and verb morphology, intended to replace the Donat. Tebaldi also described a second book on syntax that may never have appeared. (76) Tebaldi claimed in his preface that he had worked as a private Latin tutor; he seems to have been proposing his textbook for that teaching situation, not for a school open to large numbers of students. Both the title page and preface explained that Tebaldi excerpted grammatical teachings from many books, choosing only what seemed to him most valuable for a basic understanding of the subject. The result was largely a paradigm book in which the author and printers made good use of several styles and sizes of type, graduated headings, and generous white space to frame and clarify the content. It is clear, moreover, that Tebaldi himself had a hand in the design. He said his chapters will vary in length, depending on what he felt the subject required; and he marked his text for graded study on the assumption that it could be used with students of different ages and different levels of experience. Although he assumed students would be set to memorizing rules, he also included material, clearly marked with a dagger (\" ) that should not be committed to memory and which should, indeed, be omitted entirely in a first review of the subject with younger students. (77)</p>\n<p>Other experiments in design anticipated the highly analytical and hierarchical manuals printed in the seventeenth century. As early as 1581 at Venice, the printer Giorgio Angelieri offered an extensive Latin grammar which was almost surely intended to rival the comparable, comprehensive grammar of Alvares, then still fairly new on the market. Angelieri employed a variety of design elements to make his closely set pages of small type more readable and easier to follow than the cluttered Libri tres of Alvares There are paradigms in columns, points of doctrine numbered in the margins, and chapters outlined with brackets and sub-brackets. As Tebaldi would insist his printers do a decade later in Brescia, Angelieri made good use of white space to ensure the legibility of his tiny types.</p>\n<p>This Angelieri grammar is a bit of a mystery. I have found only a single fragmentary copy and the compiler listed on the title page, Richardus Hesius Amorfortius (1547-1631), was a Dutchman studying in Italy who seven years later became a Jesuit. Like the later grammar of Tebaldi, this one explicitly claims on its title page to be a compilation of the best bits from earlier textbooks, \"collected, authored, emended, and set in order\" by the young and unknown \"Richard Hees of Amersfort.\" It is hard to imagine that his slender credentials would have lent any particular authority to the book on the Venetian market, but the claim may have been a sort of anti-Alvares marketing. The Jesuits of the Collegio Romano were presenting their new single-author grammar as authoritative because of the singular learning of the Portuguese school master. Angelieri may have accepted the anthology from (or assigned the compiling work to) the young Hesius by way of spiting the concerted publicity campaign on behalf of the official, single-author Jesuit grammar. In any case, the advanced design of the book must have been a deliberate attempt to improve on that of the Venetian editions of A</p>\n<p>As in other fields of study, the late sixteenth century also saw many books ostensibly marketed for self-study of Latin. We have already seen that the proverb collection of Kaspar Schoppe fell into this category. (79) Schoppe was one of the Jesuits' sharpest critics in political and theological forums. His works on pedagogy also took direct aim at Jesuit educational methods. Schoppe was a talented marketer of his own textbooks, but his anti-Jesuit feeling was not mere marketing. When he criticized Alvares for nearly insane elaboration of the grammar textbook, he was also offering a broader critique of the Jesuit political and missionary program. (80)</p>\n<p>Self-study books typically contained extravagant claims on the part of their authors about how fast and easy it was to learn with their \"new\" methods. A good example is the grammar proposed by the Franciscan Bonaventura Buratto at Milan in 1608. The title page informs us that the book \"contains the foundation of all [Latin] grammar in a new order and with facility for memorization.\" There are 368 pages of very full and clearly organized information, arranged on highly diagrammatic pages. Buratto offered a graded-teaching pattern, and though he claimed the book was for self-study, it could as easily serve as a reference grammar for those who had already studied Latin. (81) Interestingly, the printer was Pandolfo Malatesta, who published the nostalgically conservative grammar of Giovanni Alberto Bossi in these same early years of the seventeenth century. Malatesta was the founder of a printing dynasty that would last into the eighteenth century at Milan. His willingness to offer textbooks in such radically different styles is testament both to his marketing ambitions and also to the variety of non-Jesuit or anti-Jesuit possibilities in the educational marketplace.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(76) I have found only two copies of the Institutiones; it was probably not very successful.</li>\n<li>(77) In the same years, Tebaldi edited a collection of fables for young readers; see Faerno 1591.</li>\n<li>(78) Hesius the Jesuit seems to have appeared in print officially only after 1620, and then as an editor and adapter of Alvares; see BCJ 3:348 and 4:337 and Van der Aa 3:218.</li>\n<li>(79) Schoppe 1628a; above, section 2.19</li>\n<li>(80) Schoppe 1671, 89-95.</li>\n<li>(81) Morigia 1595, 183 describes the Franciscan school at Milan.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Humanist conservatives and religious reformers were not the only critics of the Jesuits, nor did conservatives monopolize the marketing of alternative textbooks.

It was a monument, but not an unchallenged one. Critics variously complained about content, offered different teaching methods, or presented similar material with alternative design strategies. Others attempted to indict the Jesuit order and its highly successful pedagogy. (82) No surprise, then, that Alvares' grammar had a long and controversial afterlife. Conforming to the prescriptions of the 1599 <em>Ratio Studiorum</em>, the Jesuits continued to teach it until modern times.

In the eighteenth century, grammarians composed several books intended as substitutes for Alvares, but most of them actually reproduced the structure and methods of the Portuguese Jesuit. (83) A partial edition of Book Three, narrowly concerned with drilling students in prosody, had a separate afterlife from the late seventeenth century onwards, especially in Spain. But this drilling book was also published at London in 1707, 1730 and 1735, at Antwerp in 1729, at New York in 1805, and at the Jesuits' Georgetown University in 1831. The Georgetown Jesuits published a student edition of the larger grammar as late as 1895.</p>\n<p>In 1859, Alvares's full, scholarly grammar received a handsome edition at Paris, not as a Renaissance text but as a modern reference book for classroom teachers, ostensibly at least reproducing the function of the original teacher's editions of the fifteen seventies. Few textbooks of any age have lasted so long and in such varied form without being relegated to merely antiquarian interest. By the mid-nineteenth century, of course, the whole meaning of Latin grammar study had changed. The Latin course was a battlement from which educational conservatives in many countries defended the classical heritage. A comprehensive, sternly classicizing grammar was a useful tool in the defense of written Latin as a symbol of a culture that claimed to be the continuing synthesis of two millennia of wisdom. (84) Alvares's own goal and that of several generations of humanist grammarians before him had been entirely different -- to recapture classical usage and strip away the perceived falsehoods of the dark millenium between the ancient world and their own. This task they had largely accomplished. Alvares's textbooks were the fullest realization of the humanists' goal, at once rigorously systematic and exclusively classicizing. But they were also denuded of overt Christian evangelical impulses. Jesuit grammar was universalizing and intrumentalizing. It had an ideological meaning as part of triumphant Roman Catholicism in the missions and the defense of strict orthodoxy at home; but it was also useful as a basic tool for anyone who needed or wanted to employ Latin. Putting this humble sixteenth-century tool to the modern conservative use of defending Western culture was a betrayal of its own author's clear notions about the history and meaning of the Latin language.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(82) Deutscher 2002, 1013 provides figures that suggest that even in a diocese like Novara, where the education of priests was dominated by a Jesuit-run seminary, other grammars continued to be used.</li>\n<li>(83) Brizzi 1976, 265; Ballerini 1985, 259-268, 279-282; Colombat 1999, 46; Zwartjes 2000, 240-41; Waquet 2001, 26-36.</li>\n<li>(84) Waswo 1999, 410-412; Waquet 2001, 124-151.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"By the end of the sixteenth century, after only twenty five years in use, the grammar textbook of Manuel Alvares had become a symbol of the Jesuit educational system.

Giovanni Antonio Tagliente (ca. 1465?-1528?), for example, on the title page of a 1524 primer described his audience as \"œthose who know nothing \"“ young, old, and women.\" A decade earlier, Gian Alberto Bossi had praised a bequest for a grammar school for poor boys by pointing out that it would make the unlikely possible, \"The poor boy will learn as if he were a rich one.\" (2) These classifications were not condescending, just matter-of-fact, since entire social classes (and the vast majority of women) were only rarely given the opportunity to learn to read and write. Even if they achieved literacy, individuals in these groups were almost entirely excluded from the Latinate sort of education for which most early textbooks were designed. Educational (and publishing) categories were largely determined by gender and by class, though not in a symmetrical way. (3) Women and working class men were not completely barred from education, but they had few opportunities to go far in school. In the sixteenth century, vernacular textbook authors would come to appeal directly to such readers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full//6.00_Chapter_Six/HFS_019.02.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full//6.00_Chapter_Six/HFS_019.02.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Readers and listeners (click to enlarge - 311 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Tagliente elaborated on the kinds of non-Latin learners in a preface. First, he addressed his \"œMost wise readers and dearest listeners,\" in recognition that some in his audience could read with facility while others could not. Then he claimed that he intended with this book to make it possible for anyone who knew how to read to teach anyone else who could not (\"œeven women\" he added: <em>etiam le donne</em>). Moreover, his book would be useful for self-study by \"œall those who know the beginnings but do not yet read well.\" (4) Tagliente not only divided the social world of readers vertically among those who read Latin and those who did not, but he also delineated several categories among non-Latin readers, not all of them equivalent to differences in social status. Vernacular-only readers could be female or male (but not professional men). They could be looking to master simple reading skills or to achieve some level of facility in reading. They may or may not also have aspired to be able to write. This last category, furthermore, included some seeking to write in an elementary way, others whose ambitions were to facility, and even men (and more rarely, women) who aspired to write for a living, as scribes. (5)</p>\n<p>It is also clear that Tagliente was not composing a textbook in the sense of a book intended for use in a school. The schooling he imagined involved a parent teaching a child or, as he repeatedly added, a literate adult teaching an illiterate friend. The logic of this, of course, was that relatively few non-Latin schools existed. Not surprisingly, therefore, there were few vernacular textbooks before the invention of printing. Such texts as came to exist were often self-help or how-to manuals. This chapter will concern a broad range of non-Latin instructional books. It does not attempt to be comprehensive, merely to give some examples of the variety of publishing for learners outside the elitist, establishmentarian Latin schools.</p>\n<p>Tagliente's complex understanding of the public for his textbooks was possible only because he stood at the end of a long philological achievement, the humanist invention of a carefully periodized history of Latin and its descendant languages. The humanists had discovered that language was socially determined. They understood that languages were the products of speech communities that could be large or local and that varied from social class to social class. (6) An author, then, might well conceive a specific public for a given book, but once it was offered on the open market, its audience could vary greatly. Once a text was annotated, commented upon, translated, or reformatted it became a new work with a new audience. This understanding stood behind the successful marketing of Latin textbooks and it would become important to the development and marketing of learning tools in the vernaculars.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(1) Grendler 1989, 86-108.</li>\n<li>(2) <em>Libro maistrevole</em>, Tagliente 1524d, 3: <em>li grandi &#x26; li piccoli &#x26; ... le Donne che niente sanno</em>; this translation is that of Anne Schutte 1986; later in this chapter I also follow her translations.

Latin textbooks, both before and for a century and more after the invention of printing, were designed to fit neatly into an existing Latin course that was much the same everywhere. The typical author of such a textbook was himself a teacher who wrote in the first instance for his own classroom. If he was proposing something innovative and wanted to sell his book widely, he would still work within established norms and label his book for a specific portion of the curriculum familiar to other teachers. In the first decades of printing, then, teachers were effectively in charge; they set the tone for what publishers produced. Latin textbooks followed teaching practice rather than leading it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full//6.00_Chapter_Six/HFS_022.01.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full//6.00_Chapter_Six/HFS_022.01.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Textbooks for aspiring merchants (click to enlarge - 444 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Vernacular instructional books, on the other hand, had few precedents and no set style of presentation; they did not conform to a fixed curriculum. Their authors were virtually on their own. If they could find parallels in the Latin teaching tradition as guides, they could follow them. But vernacular authors were not beholden to an established corps of teachers. They had more freedom to develop new teaching methods, set the tone of their work to fit the temperament of the audience they envisioned, and even to invent new genres of textbook. One result of this fluid market is that many vernacular treatments of specific subjects read more like manuals for reference than instructional materials; it is often difficult to know how they were used. This interpretive problem is particularly acute in the case of books on technological or artisanal subjects since an elementary manual may have served to introduce a subject to interested individuals who never intended to master the art in question. (7)</p>\n<p>Language arts offer an example of this genre problem. The only possible manuscript-textbook precedent for elementary language study in Italian was the syllabary or \"œBabuino,\" which may have existed in the early fifteenth century in the form of a handwritten classroom poster. The earliest surviving syllabary was printed in Venice or Treviso about 1478. Aldo Manuzio included a similar one in his Latin grammar of 1498, taking it over from the usage of vernacular classrooms. The first surviving copy clearly intended for Italian-language reading instruction dates from 1505. However, as Piero Lucchi has shown, syllabaries of the sort had been part of a vernacular, commercial arithmetic course (called <em>abaco</em>, English \"reckoning\") before printed versions appeared. The Babuino was a marginal phenomenon in Latin-school terms but it had a clear place in the reckoning curriculum. By contrast, the vernacular language-skills textbooks that came into print in the fifteen twenties were entirely new creations. They had no set place in the schools and so they addressed a great variet</p>\n<p>The authors of elementary mathematics textbooks had more models to contemplate but they too had to be inventive in creating print products. No full-dress arithmetic textbooks survive from before the age of printing, presumably because students in the commercial arithmetic schools did not possess them. They would instead have learned methods and rules by memory and by working out problems on slates or in paper notebooks. (9) Teachers may have had course books or outlines, but those materials do not survive. Still, we know some instructional texts existed because fragments of them can be found in merchants' notebooks. One of the earliest, a chapter on multiplying fractions copied about 1416, is specifically recommended as useful for merchants who may have forgotten the rules they learned in school. Printing would allow arithmetic students to repeat a pattern we have already seen in Latin classrooms. Not only would each pupil own his own book, but the mature merchant would also keep his textbook on hand to refresh his memory when out-of-the-ordinary computation needs arose. (10)</p>\n<p>While the publishers of Latin-school textbooks vied for a market of boys all educated more or less to the same pattern, publishers for vernacular-only students had a far less predictable audience. The vernacular textbooks these publishers put out concerned reading, writing, and arithmetic, especially commercial mathematics and record-keeping. At somewhat more advanced levels they offered works on geography, music, surveying, and other skills, some of which will occupy us later in sections 6.16 to 6.19. Perhaps just because the elementary guides in Italian did not follow an established school course, new manuals and textbooks did not appear in print in pedagogical order. Indeed, new forms did not appear at all in the first few decades of printing. Then, shortly before and after the turn of the sixteenth century, new vernacular textbooks came into print in exactly the reverse order from that of their pedagogical logic. Only the commercial mathematics books had real medieval precedents, and these appeared first in print in a form that suggests they exactly reproduce existing course materials. The first attested reckoning book in print, a substantial teacher's manual, dates from 1478. Commercial math books clearly intended to be put in the hands of students were becoming common by 1510 or so. The first printed handwriting manual appeared in 1514. And the first vernacular reading book to survive is the <em>Teaching Book</em> (<em>Libro maistrevole</em>) of Tagliente, cited in section 6.01. It was published in 1524.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full//6.00_Chapter_Six/HFS_019.01.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full//6.00_Chapter_Six/HFS_019.01.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Calligraphic style (click to enlarge - 551 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Giovanni Antonio Tagliente himself was a key figure in Italian textbook history; he authored early works in all three of these fields of study.

The preface to this <em>Principles of Trade</em> (<em>Ragione di mercantia</em>) acknowledged the help of Alvise Fontana who seems, therefore, to have been a mathematics consultant to the Tagliente family. The <em>Ragione</em> preserved the structure of the 1515 <em>Thesoro</em> but considered the basic math functions more thoroughly and offered better practical advice. In the multiplication section, for example, the <em>Thesoro</em> diagrams are used to represent eight methods of multiplying, but while the <em>Thesoro</em> had left it to the reader to figure out each method, the <em>Ragione</em> parsed each diagram with careful instructions. The <em>Ragione</em> also conformed closely to the mature design sensibility of Giovanni Antonio Tagliente. (15)</p>\n<p>The <em>Ragione</em> was apparently never reprinted, but the <em>Thesoro</em> in its original form received many editions. Only a few copies of any given printing survive, as is the case with most small commercial arithmetics. It is hard to tell how or if they competed with one another or with other books on the market. Still, it seems likely that books of the sort were produced in large numbers and that they had a long shelf-life in bookshops. One copy of the 1525 <em>Ragione</em> has the ownership mark of a velvet weaver who bought it, presumably new, in July of 1564. (16) Editions of the <em>Thesoro</em> continued to appear until 1586. The preface to a 1548 edition of the <em>Thesoro</em> from the presses of Giovanni Padovano seems to imply that the book had been off the Venice market for some time, but that assertion is hard to verify. Instead it was probably mere convention when the editor said of his copy text that, \"soiled and marred by numerous stains, it had passed through the hands of many students of the arithmetical art\" before he picked it up for reprinting.

The authors did not pretend to cover an entire field, nor were their books designed for a specific school course. The treatments are highly incomplete even for the limited fields they addressed. It may be that Tagliente had in mind to simplify these skills to the point where how-to manuals could substitute for professional tuition. More likely still, he intended them as pocket-sized books of reference that would remind adults what they had learned in school.

As we have seen, Tagliente's <em>Luminario</em> of 1525 concentrated single-mindedly on bookkeeping, while Borghi's 1484 <em>Libro de abacho</em> attempted to ground merchant practice in a somewhat broader study of arithmetic based on the traditional abaco school course. An early printed imitation of Borghi was Calandri's 1491 <em>De arithmetica</em>, but books of this type continued to be produced in manuscript too, especially at Florence. (28) Books in both these general formats persisted well into the seventeenth century and offered practical courses increasingly divorced from pure arithmetic, to say nothing of higher mathematics.</p>\n<p>A turning point came in the fifteen thirties, when the market matured to the degree that various elementary textbooks competed directly with each other. At just this period, moreover, writers for the elementary book market also began to feel the broader impulse to write in standard Tuscan. (29) The elaborate introduction to Giovanni Sfortunati's 1534 <em>New Beacon, a Book of Arithmetic</em> pointed to these new linguistic and market conditions. Sfortunati (b. ca. 1500) introduced himself as a Sienese schoolmaster who had taught arithmetic all over Italy and Sicily. He was a native speaker of Tuscan, then, but one with broad experience of other Italian students. This self-advertisement quickly turned into a claim that he was uniquely quickly turned into a claim that he was uniquely qualified to review the older arithmetic books on the market by way of recommending his own. He praised Luca Pacioli's Summa but noted that it contained too much that was not useful for merchants. Similarly Filippo Calandri's book was very learned but did not explain elementary notions well enough to be truly useful for beginners. Sfortunati then turned to Borghi's Libro de abacho. Fifty years old and well established in the market, Borghi's manual was the principal competition for any new elementary arithmetic book in 1534. Sfortunati claimed to have read it many times, implying perhaps that he had been constrained to teach from it. He rejected it because it was written in rough Venetian dialect and described Venetian business practices that were of little use to Tuscans or other Italians. (30) Despite his claims, however, Sfortunati's arithmetic book was also highly traditional. There was little to differentiate it from Borghi's treatment except his good Tuscan. His New Beacon was just old-fashioned abaco with new advertising.</p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/6.00_Chapter_Six/Case-L-10.15,-Le-pratiche-delle-dve-prime-matematiche,-di-Pietro-Cataneo,-title-page.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/6.00_Chapter_Six/Case-L-10.15,-Le-pratiche-delle-dve-prime-matematiche,-di-Pietro-Cataneo,-title-page.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Selling parents on modern math (click to enlarge - 645 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Pietro Cataneo (d. ca. 1569) presented a more progressive approach in his 1546 <em>Practice of the Two Basic Mathematics</em>.

Some authors concerned themselves exclusively with bookkeeping practice. Others aimed at a more systematic arithmetic course. At the upper end, there were also mathematics-theory treatises, which will not for the most part concern us here, except insofar as they served as sources for the textbook-level works. (19)</p>\n<p>We know that an extensive, multi-year course in commercial mathematics was available to urban students all over Northern Italy, and that it was fairly standardized by the mid-fifteenth century if not also before. Tagliente's books were too sketchy to have fit this course, but other textbooks did. The very first surviving printed book for teaching commercial math is the so-called <em>Treviso Arithmetic</em> of 1478. It is an altogether more substantial book than those of Tagliente and at the date it probably was intended as a teacher's manual. The Treviso book presented a basic, overall treatment of what we know was the standard arithmetic course in reckoning schools. Although primarily concerned with teaching practical skills, it covered all the basic arithmetic concepts and functions. It does not seem to have been reprinted. (20)</p>\n<p>More influential by far than the <em>Treviso Arithmetic</em> was the nearly contemporary course book of Pietro Borghi, usually titled simply <em>Book on Commercial Math</em> (<em>Libro de abacho</em>). It saw at least seventeen editions between the first known one in 1484 and the end of the sixteenth century. Early editions advertise Borghi's ambition to provide a business-school course, \"Here begins the noble work On Arithmetic, in which all things concerning business practice are treated.\" Later versions are more specific about the elementary character of the work, by way of distinguishing it from more substantial books.

Although Calandri covered virtually the same material and claimed a similar audience of \"artisans and merchants,\" he and his printer took a much more traditionalizing, humanistic approach to the look of the book. There is no title page, but on the page facing the preface there appears a majestic, seated teacher in a classroom with students. The scene is labeled, \"Pythagoras, Inventor of Arithmetic.\" The book then begins with a salutation that embedded the title of the work in a supposed network of patronage: \"A small work of Filippo Calandri On Arithmetic, [dedicated] to Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici.\" The preface goes on to claim preeminence in commerce for Florence and to claim that the author went to a great deal of trouble to make sure the book was printed in \"the Florentine style.\" The exact meaning of <em>lo stile fiorentino</em> is unclear, but it may very well have to do with the elegant dress of the book by comparison to the homely look of earlier</p>\n<p>The increasingly popularizing dress of Borghi's book reflected a change in the usages of theorists, math teachers, and business people alike between 1470 and 1520. In exactly this period most authors finally left Roman numerals behind in favor of Hindu-Arabic ones. Well into the sixteenth century, however, textbook authors recognized that the new system of notation was less familiar to many readers and required some new habits -- strict adherence to columns, for example. Printing was key to the rapid progress of mathematics education. It was easier to teach notation systematically when every student had a nearly identical printed textbook than when the class worked from handwritten examples. By the third decade of the sixteenth century, this idea that each student in a class had an identical (or at least closely similar) textbook was taken for granted. (23)</p>\n<p>The increasing availability of printed texts also meant that the kinds of math books available multiplied. Two main types are easy to distinguish by style and level of detail. Primarily theoretical works like that of Luca Pacioli framed their discussions academically with humanist commonplaces about the value of mathematics. Their authors dwelt at length on definitions of terms and concepts and put readers through long series of problems. Some problems required working with enormous numbers, offered, it would seem, primarily to provide practice in computing that would reinforce theoretical concepts. Similarly, the theory books included many methods for solving the same problems. These were offered both as methods of computing and also as \"proofs\" for checking the accuracy of complicated computations. By contrast, more practically-oriented textbooks like Borghi's <em>Libro de abacho</em> simplified the definitions or omitted them entirely; offered fewer problems; never required computing with numbers larger than those commonly encountered in business; and gave a single method of computing and annotating each problem with just one or two kinds of \"proof.\" (24) In addition to these real, substantial textbooks at various levels, there was also a form of <em>abaco</em> book that was just a prompt or aide-memoire. A Perugia <em>Abbaco</em> of 1573 is typical. Its eight leaves contain tables for multiplication, division, and currency exchange and, on the last leaf, eight simple narrative problems. Booklets like this might have been given to very elementary students while their teachers used a more formal textbook.</p>\n<p>Like other early arithmetics for the reckoning schools, Borghi's presented the elementary mathematical functions first, but not in the order to which we are now accustomed. He began with multiplication, and then described division, addition, and subtraction. This order is so regular in early Italian books of <em>abaco</em> that it must have been the usual way of teaching the functions in reckoning schools at least until the fifteen twenties, even though the theoretical writers strongly recommended starting with addition. (25) Borghi's treatment of multiplication was typical. He presented thorough multiplication tables and then demonstrated their application with practical problems of increasing difficulty. The layout of the page assumed that the student would be referring back to the multiplication tables (or that they had been memorized) for each step of a problem. Pacioli had demonstrated no fewer than eight ways of visualizing a given multiplication problem on paper, because he expected his readers to comprehend all the various ways of arriving at a solution. Borghi just wanted his students to get to an answer and then move on to the next problem.

The title page announced that bookkeeping of the sort described here was specifically intended for householders, legal guardians, and administrators of guilds or societies. In a dedication to a Bolognese nobleman, Venturoli made it clear that his book was also an invitation to social mobility, suggesting that some of the servant boys in his patron's household might find the book a stepping stone to better employment later in life. An address to the reader followed, offering a pastiche of commonplaces: No one should take offense at what they fail to find here. This book is merely a simple introduction, not meant to replace more advanced books. It is intended only for beginners, not for those who have already mastered the subject. Apparently, Venturoli did not want to seem to be offering his book to pre-professional students of bookkeeping. On the other hand, to this almost abject introduction Venturoli appended a list of his sources, which range widely and ambitiously. He listed a few standard authors on bookkeeping (Pacioli and Manzoni) and others on commercial and domestic economy, but he also claimed greater weight for his work by citing the laws and statutes of Italian cities, a collection of papal bulls, the Code of Justinian with its learned glosses, St. Thomas Aquinas, and holy writ. At least in the popular market, then, it was not unseemly advertising to claim that bookkeeping had its place in a long tradition of high culture.</p>\n<p>Manzoni's, Casanova's, and Venturoli's preoccupation with the formal qualities of the ledger reflected a general tendency throughout our period to see careful record keeping (and good, clear handwriting too) as part of honest commercial practice. Tagliente and others published manuals in several fields relating to record keeping -- reading, writing, and <em>abaco</em>. Manzoni went so far as to offer a reading and calligraphy manual as an elementary introduction to his books on accounting. (40) Readers of bookkeeping manuals were repeatedly warned to keep their records neatly and accurately and to avoid falling into the vice of \"ill kept accounts\" (<em>scritture mal tenute</em>) which would later have to be \"re-ordered\"</p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/6.00_Chapter_Six/H-3.9397,-Scorta-di-economia_-o-sia,-Dialogo-di-scrittvra-famigliare,-pg.3v-4r.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/6.00_Chapter_Six/H-3.9397,-Scorta-di-economia_-o-sia,-Dialogo-di-scrittvra-famigliare,-pg.3v-4r.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">h-39397-scorta-di-economia_-oe28099-sia-dialogo-di-scrittvra-famigliare-pg3v-4r-thumb</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Bookkeeping usage was as important to merchants of the sixteenth century as classicizing grammar was to contemporary humanists.

To modern readers, they seem so perennial a form that it is hard to imagine how the schools went for fifty years and more after the invention of printing without textbooks for handwriting. Like many a manual skill, however, handwriting had a firmly entrenched tradition of teaching by personal demonstration and learning by doing that no doubt limited the perceived need for new tools. (44) Only when handwriting was proposed as a self-teachable, how-to discipline, did printed manuals appear.</p>\n<p>A clear set of personalities was involved in the creation of the new form. We start, again, with Giovanni Antonio Tagliente. His first calligraphic manual was entitled <em>The Present Book Teaches the True Art of Writing Many Sorts of Letters Very Well</em>. It appeared in 1524, a decade after the first known handwriting book by Sigismondo Fanti (d. ca 1520?) and within a year of one authored by Ludovico Arrighi (d. 1527). Tagliente was about Fanti's age; both were older by a generation than Arrighi. Tagliente had been teaching the chancery hand (<em>cancelleresca</em>) demonstrated in his book for at least thirty years in Venice. He claims to have invented several new teaching methods, but until his book was printed, he presumably followed the age-old practice of providing his students with handwritten models for copying. (45)</p>\n<p>What is most striking about this new form of textbook is that it was born fully developed. Fanti's, Tagliente's, and Arrighi's textbooks (and most calligraphy manuals for a generation afterward) looked alike and covered virtually the same material. The three works appeared in a small, broad quarto booklets that allowed the display of multiple lines of fluid script in letter format. All three authors declared that the basic and indispensable hand was the <em>cancelleresca</em> and they gave detailed instructions for achieving it stage by stage. They began with cutting the quill and moved on to rhythm, spacing, and layout. All three shared a method of analyzing scripts stroke by stroke, and they proposed a common method of learning through repetition first of the strokes, then of letters, and</p>\n<p>None of these forms had ever been presented in print before but suddenly here they were, described by Fanti in 1514 and displayed in splendid woodcuts made between 1522 and 1525 at the behest of Tagliente and Arrighi. Obviously a long-standing tradition of pedagogy stood behind the new textbooks. But several new cultural trends also contributed to the creation of such books: the sixteenth-century urge to record in print all manner of arts and sciences; the growth of bureaucratic scribing and the need for widely accepted models that could be diffused through print; a general increase in literacy, especially in the vernacular. It was, moreover, the \"age of how-to\" when many kinds of practical skills became fodder for popularizers and when print was the preferred medium for such experiments. (48)</p>\n<p>The reason for a sudden burst of activity precisely in the fifteen twenties is less clear. Some personal considerations may have pushed the genre into existence. Tagliente knew he was nearing the end of his working life and probably wanted to leave a legacy in print on the model of his commercial mathematics books. Arrighi on the other hand was still vigorous and ambitious; he had been cultivating a reputation as a scribe and printer at Rome for a decade or so. It is also possible that a rivalry between the two was spurred on by the approaching jubilee year of 1525. At least one handwriting booklet specifically says that it was \"designed and made ... in this holy year of 1525.\" Since these small, handsome books were collector's items from the start and represented what was newest and most fashionable in Italian design, some authors may well have had a souvenir market in mind.

Much more elaborate and more single-minded accounting textbooks were quickly produced, however, starting with the remarkable 1534 <em>Double-Entry Ledger and Its Day-Book</em> of Domenico Manzoni (dates unknown). Manzoni gave general and specialized rules for keeping a whole range of business ledgers, most of them derived from the bookkeeping section of Pacioli's <em>Summa</em>. Manzoni's most original contribution was that he illustrated the method with two, full-year specimen account books, first the daily account or day-book (<em>giornale</em>) and then the corresponding double-entry ledger (<em>quaderno doppio</em>). Double-entry, of course, was the pride of Venetian business culture, what Manzoni's title page advertises as the \"practice of Venice.\" (35) Little is known of Manzoni except what he tells us in his prefaces, and that is next to nothing in strictly biographical terms. He came from Oderzo on the Venetian mainland and he affected a certain aristocratic and philosophical stance, but his book is supremely practical. He apparently taught mathematics in a Venice school and he authored other textbooks. (36)</p>\n<p>Manzoni must have had good relations with his printer, Comin da Trino, for together they took considerable pains to make the specimen books (respectively forty and ninety-six pages in length) look realistic. Each has a mock-calligraphic title page that suggests how a merchant should open his blank ledger. The type in the body of the book is arranged in narrow columns to the left of each page to imitate the entry columns of the ledgers, and the empty spaces above and below entries are carefully filled with cancellation marks of the sort bookkeepers used to ensure that no false information was later supplied. The double-entry specimen reproduces the facing page format that all the bookkeeping teachers of the day recommended. Manzoni's precepts, like those of his principal source Pacioli, actually lagged some decades behind the current practice of the most sophisticated Venetian merchants. (37) This elaborate textbook, then, could have been intended in large part for an export market, to introduce the practices of the Adriatic metropolis to non-Venetians. Comin da Trino may have had the same market in mind for another bookkeeping manual with lengthy specimens, that of Alvise Casanova (dates unknown), published in 1558. Unlike Manzoni, Casanova does not seem to have been a schoolmaster. Instead he held several government accounting posts and practiced privately. Like Tagliente's <em>Lucidario</em>, Casanova's title boasted of the practical demonstrations on offer: <em>A Most Bright Mirror in Which One May Observe Well Defined All the Types and Forms of Records That Should Be Kept in Business</em>.

Not all of them were so elaborate, however, and most in fact dispensed with the idea of providing a lengthy (and repetitive) specimen account book. It was more usual to set out each rule simply and exemplify each kind of entry just once or twice. One such popularization from the end of our period is Giacomo Venturoli's <em>Guide to Economics, or rather, Dialogue on Everyday Bookkeeping</em>, published at Bologna in 1666 and reprinted at least three times up to 1717. Venturoli (dates unknown) was a priest who taught \"practical arithmetic\" in the catechism schools at Bologna. Later he authored a successful elementary textbook under the title <em>A Brief Compendium of All the Rules of Arithmetic</em>. (39) Venturoli's bookkeeping manual falls into the tradition of Tagliente and Manzoni, but he cast this textbook in the form of a dialogue between father and son. The dialogue was a popularizing literary device and definitely not an imitation of humanist dialogues. The father-son interaction reinforced the notion that bookkeeping was essential to good family life. The son has been studying arithmetic for some time and now his hard-nosed father wants him to recite what he has learned, starting with definitions and progressing step by step. The book is summary (there are only seventy three pages of text), but it covers a fair amount, including many kinds of computations that can be accomplished using the data account books embody. The father repeatedly asks for general rules and then poses related problems to be solved. At the end he asks what kind of examinations the bookkeeping master administers, and his son replies with a very thorough list that is in effect the outline of a bookkeeping course.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(35) By the end of the sixteenth century, \"in the Italian manner\" was the usual way of describing double-entry; Parker 1984, 175-176; Ciocci 2003, 227.</li>\n<li>(36) There were at least five editions of Manzoni's book, but they are fairly rare and the relationship between them has never been studied.

Almost without exception they are crowded, ugly little productions. Attempts to prettify them with ornamental cuts, red-and-black printing, or large initials usually just made them cluttered and homely. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that their design was, consciously or not, a condescension. Children who learned to read only in the vernacular were second-class students by comparison with those boys who were intended for a Latin education. Condescension was the most common mindset of the educators of the early sixteenth century towards their vernacular-only students. In school books it was expressed in texts and formatting alike.</p>\n<p>At mid-century, the Council of Trent and the general reform of Catholic institutions which followed had a salutary effect on primary education, not least in transforming this attitude of condescension into one of Christian compassion. There was no question of breaking down distinctions of social class. Education would continue to have a separate track for privileged, Latin-school students. But contextualizing reading instruction within the teaching of Christian doctrine meant that basic literacy became a logical (if not quite essential) part of everyday Christian life. By the end of the third quarter of the century, most cities in Italy had organized catechism classes called Schools of Christian Doctrine. These schools prompted the production of enormous numbers of small catechisms and other devotional works at an elementary level for reading by their students. (71)</p>\n<p>Marketing considerations were never completely absent from the making of Christian Doctrine school books, of course. But printers and publishers were not leading the market but rather following the dictates of religious educators. Confusion and differences of opinion among educators, not competition among printers, resulted in considerable variety in the booklets made available to students in the catechism schools. (72) For printers, the manufacture in quantity of Christian Doctrine textbooks was an opportunity to benefit from a large, guaranteed market. And to the degree that such schools created readers of devotional literature for the future, the printers could anticipate an ever-larger market for simple religious books. In the second third of the sixteenth century, catechisms and other small religious textbooks joined Latin school books and popular secular literature among the bread-and-butter titles of any urban printing house. Small printing of the sort k</p>\n<p>Illustrated catechisms picked up on Giovanni Antonio Tagliente's theme of learning in a family context. One edition of Giovanni Battista Eliano's <em>Dottrina Christiana</em> (a Jesuit catechism) even printed a promissory note that emphasized the economy of grace involved in teaching and learning the catechism in a family setting. Apparently intended for the father or mother of a family, the booklet contained a blank form that read: \"This <em>Christian Doctrine</em> was given to me by [blank] so that I and my entire family will learn the facts of the holy faith. With God's help I will earnestly try to learn it and to teach it to all in my house, and I will be obliged to pray to Our Lord for [blank] \" Such illustrated catechisms allowed lay people to teach each other. They were part of a concerted effort by Catholic preachers to encourage reading of approved devotional literature (by contrast to the Protestants' reading of Scripture in the vernaculars).

Among the few that survive are the works of a Florentine writing master, who styled himself Giovambaptista Verini. The market for Verini's books probably consisted largely of his own students at Florence, Venice, and Milan. In 1526-27, clearly imitating the success of Tagliente and Arrighi, Verini issued a rather elaborate series of models in four books (each with a separate title page, although they are foliate</p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full//6.00_Chapter_Six/HFS_025.02.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full//6.00_Chapter_Six/HFS_025.02.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Teaching writing in woodcuts (click to enlarge - 735 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Book One gives detailed instructions for the pen work of a gothic hand described stroke by stroke. Book Two gives geometrical constructions for this same letter form. Book Three is a constructed roman alphabet on models like those Sigismondo Fanti and Luca Pacioli (the mathematician) had published earlier in the century. Book Four is highly miscellaneous. It is arranged around a large, beautiful alphabet of initials in Flemish interlace style, but the rest of the contents do not much hang together. (57)</p>\n<p>Verini went on to issue a whole series of other, more modest booklets on writing, first at Venice and later in Milan. As time went on, these small productions seem more and more unambitious. Verini reused blocks from the <em>Luminario</em> which got badly worn. Although they are all slight, his pamphlets also got more and more miscellaneous. Some, like his <em>Really Fine Secrets and Methods Newly Studied</em> (<em>Secreti et modi bellissimi nuovamente investigati</em>), are not really instructional books at all but mere parlor amusements.

Taken as a series, these works betray a career in decline. (59) In content Verini's pamphlets are dizzyingly miscellaneous, mixing rough pictorial woodcuts, calligraphic specimens, oversize initials, and occasional typeset texts. Some of the pieces in these books do not relate to any kind of writing or reading; instead they advise about how to behave in various social situations. This courtesy-book stuff is a clue to how Verini must have expected these booklets to be used. They are occasional practice pieces for boys in his school and edifying, \"finishing\" exercises for his lady students. Both these kinds of students are explicitly mentioned in these later books.

Ugo da Carpi and Eustachio Celebrino, engravers for Arrighi and Tagliente, reused and re-cut their best blocks for books issued under their own names. Giovambaptista Verini, however, seems to have been the greatest master of this kind of adaptive reuse. Stanley Morison calls it plagiarism because Verini in the <em>Luminario</em> of 1527 presented copies of specimens from Arrighi and Tagliente and took over his titles from earlier works. But plagiarism is not an appropriate construct to apply in such cases. The period saw so many new calligraphic models come on to the market, both in classrooms and in print, that writing masters of the period could pick and choose freely among available models. Privileges were granted for these books, but they did not protect the content in any significant way. The point of a writing manual, after all, was to encourage its readers to copy the models it offered.

The most striking case is that of the alphabet of large, flourished initials in a Low-Countries gothic style, each of which occupies half a page of his <em>Luminario</em>. These gothic capitals recur in almost every subsequent book of Verini's, where they are displayed on much smaller pages but never to the same purpose as in the <em>Luminario</em>. (62)</p>\n<p>As with <em>abaco</em> books, then, the smaller and more elementary the writing book was and the fewer the pretensions it had to a broad audience, the more likely it was to be derivative and out of date. To some degree this was an inevitable consequence of the process of popularization inherent in composing basic textbooks and practical manuals, especially when they were translated from Latin originals. But among authors of language-skills books there was also a distinct element of condescension. No matter how strenuously they professed to be liberating their students from the tyranny of the \"Empire of Latin\" (FranÃ§oise Waquet's term), language teachers subscribed to the commonplace that vernacular-only instruction was for second-class students. (63)</p>\n<p>This condescending stance stands in contrast to the optimism and can-do attitude of many popularizing how-to books for scientific and craft disciplines produced in the same period. These always included a great deal of traditional lore, but they often also reported new techniques and theories within a few years of their devising. Unlike language study where claims of novelty were almost always trumped up, authors in these truly new disciplines of the age of print were not wedded to the past and instead saw the potential of print for diffusing new knowledge. We considered the case of humanist geographies that brought discoveries into the classroom (in section 4.16). More popularizing how-to books offered the pleasure of owning new facts and methods personally in the form of an inexpensive book, of \"taking knowledge, literally and figuratively, into one's own hands.\" (64) Upper-end writing books, as we have seen, strained to achieve the same progressive air, both in the presentation of new fashions in writing and lettering and in claiming new social status for their authors. By contrast, elementary writing books display a pedagogy wedded to the past. Writing was a skill with an increasingly large public, but one that should, these authors thought, be divided and segregated by class and gender.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(57) Verini 1527 and 1947; further on Verini, Morison 1953; Gehl 2008a.</li>\n<li>(58) Verini 1528.</li>\n<li>(59) Verini 1530, 1532, 1536a, 1536b, and 1966, 7-18; Morison 1953, 43; Gehl 2008a, 47-50.

(66) But there were no catechisms in Italian before 1530. The first full-blown vernacular reading textbook in Italy, then, was almost surely the strikingly non-religious <em>Libro maistrevole</em> of Giovanni Antonio Tagliente, dated 1524. Tagliente reveals a great deal about the facts of his invention. Indeed he spent five pages of his twenty-page booklet on an apology for it. We learn that Tagliente had taught reading as well as writing for many years, and that his son Paolo helped in bringing the project for a reading book into print. The elder Tagliente further implied that his decision to publish the work derived from the sense of duty he acquired as a servant of the Venetian state, even that he was charged (as an appointed teacher in the state schools) to find better methods of teaching non-Latin students. At Venice, state schooling for scribes was limited to a few students at a time. Tagliente claimed that the need for reading was so widespread in urban society that self-help books like his were called for. Anne Schutte points out that he saw this as a secular, specifically non-religious need in Venice, the commercial capital of the Mediterranean. Tagliente was not anti-clerical or irreligious, but religious education was not his brief. He carefully excluded devotional material from his textbook. It is less certain that he accurately understood the potential audience, since the <em>Libro maistrevole</em>, unlike other textbooks he authored, was apparently never reprinted. Later reading-book authors deliberately included the prayers and pious texts that were traditional for teaching reading to small children from the Middle Ages forward, exactly the sort of thing Tagliente left out.

At various times he called his students <em>bono, sollicito, prudente, valente</em> and the like, repeating the kind of encouraging compliment an affectionate teacher should constantly give the student. As Schutte notes, these claims do not seem to be mere advertising; they almost surely represent Tagliente's classroom practice of many decades. (68) Other telling bits of the <em>Libro maistrevole</em> must derive from Tagliente's classroom too, as when he explained the meaning of \"œsyllable\" by inviting the student to imagine a man on his sick bed who can only call out for the maidservant by gasping her name syllable by syllable, \"œMa-da-le-na!\" On the other hand, the fact that Tagliente's reading book appeared in the same year as his handwriting manual (and close in time to his arithmetic books) suggests that all these new books were aimed at a how-to market that Tagliente had only recently identified, and not at his students of many years.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full//6.00_Chapter_Six/HFS_019.03.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full//6.00_Chapter_Six/HFS_019.03.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Letters of the alphabet (click to enlarge - 992 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Although Tagliente explicitly disparaged the long and complicated course of Latin reading skills sanctioned by tradition, his own book proceeded in much the same order.

Then, returning briefly to a commonplace of traditional Latinate pedagogy, he added a few moral proverbs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full//6.00_Chapter_Six/HFS_019.06.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full//6.00_Chapter_Six/HFS_019.06.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Writing samples in woodcut (click to enlarge - 531 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Anne Schutte believes that the sample letters, the moral proverbs, and some specimens of merchant hand (<em>mercantesca</em>) at the close of the <em>Libro maistrevole</em> were miscellaneous and casual additions to fill out the pamphlet.

(69) But it is just as likely that the thoughtful Tagliente set out to give his neophyte readers some additional reading samples for practice. The letters and the otherwise unrelated <em>mercantesca</em> specimens were good practice in real-life reading, while the proverbs reinforced the kind of moral thought that parents and teachers of the period universally recommended, even when, as Tagliente did, they chose not to emphasize Christian themes. Tagliente's contemporary Marin Sanudo (1466-1535) expressed this sense of a good literary education when he described Venetians students wishing \"to acquire virtue and become learned\" and called state-school teachers like Tagliente men \"who teach virtue and grammar to the young patricians and others.\" (70)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full//6.00_Chapter_Six/HFS_019.05.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full//6.00_Chapter_Six/HFS_019.05.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Sample letter (click to enlarge - 536 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>The <em>Libro maistrevole</em> is very handsome.

The typeface has numerous outsize ligatures to imitate chancery hand; and the body of the type is very large, so the space between lines is unusually generous for so small a booklet. The spacing has a pedagogical intent too, as we can deduce from Tagliente's advice to the teacher to use a knife or pointer to indicate the letters and syllables that the student is to read aloud. Tagliente's professionalism as writing master shows through in every line of type. His layouts offered the inexpert new readers a page that is both charming and highly legible.

As we have already seen, many vernacular textbooks took on the character of how-to books. Reading, writing, and arithmetic were, at this elementary level, skills to be mastered with minimal formal tuition. The formulaic methods of the humanist Latin school assumed years of study aimed at life-long learning. These lengthy courses could be significantly abbreviated and watered down for learners who did not want to master a second language and whose needs (and skills) were elementary.</p>\n<p>As this audience of literate-but-not-learned readers expanded during the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, publishers ever more often assumed the role of \"culture brokers\" (the term is William Eamon's) or \"translators\" (as we described them in sections 4.01, 4.14, and 4.19). They digested and abstracted Latin literary and scientific culture for the use of a large, urban public. One Italian publisher described his ideal audience as \"thoughtful and modest youths.\" A German author of the same period said he published \"for the simple, respectable, and devout little people.\" Such readers might look to books for amusement and edification, but beyond literature and religious texts, they also wanted straightforward prose with lots of useful information and practical advice. The how-to model could be extended to many skills. Simple manuals multiplied, especially on the model of arithmetic books that offered a series of discrete problems to pose and solve. Gardening, agronomy, cookery, housekeeping, sewing, lace making, embroidery, sign painting, metallurgy, glassblowing, dyeing and many other craft disciplines soon occupied cheap little how-to books. (76)</p>\n<p>In some cases these booklets were authored by the same supposed experts who wrote handwriting or arithmetic texts. In others the authors were clerics who saw these practical books as ways to inculcate Christian morals along with the practical skills that recommended the books in the first place. Almost always, authors of manuals stressed the moral dimensions of social life. Habits of thrift, choosing the right tools, practicing techniques to perfection, being careful and vigilant, and keeping good records were not just good economics, they were also essential to the humble citizen's salvation. Books of this moralizing sort made it increasingly possible, even socially acceptable, to learn entirely outside the confines of a school. For ambitious individuals not born into social elites, the normal course of learning was self-directed and entirely outside the confines of formal schooling. Childhood schooling remained the preserve of a privileged minority, so for most people functional literacy was achieved only in adulthood. Their classrooms could be anywhere --shops, streets, and churches, but most of all at home. Their teachers were friends or relatives or even just the books they could find.

But the publishing norms and the economics of the market for such serious skills textbooks will be clearer if we first examine a few examples of a humbler genre, one aimed at the non-professional adult learner. For our purposes the catch-all form of the <em>ricettario</em> serves best to illumine how sixteenth-century authors adapted medieval antecedents in order to create a new genre.</p>\n<p>The word <em>ricettario</em> literally means recipe book, but <em>ricettari</em> were not cookbooks in any modern sense. Their common element was that they offered formulas (<em>ricetti</em>) to solve everyday problems. Most often the formula involved making some sort of preparation appropriate to a particular ailment, beauty need, handyman's project, or self-improvement. The formulas often included superstitious or magical elements --actions or words unrelated to the practical mixing up of the glue, ointment. lotion, or powder. The formulas sometimes aimed more at creating a need than at solving a real-life problem. (78)</p>\n<p>Medieval recipe collections were common and provided sources for most sixteenth-century <em>ricettari</em>. In the Middle Ages, such books were typically called books of secrets and they partook of the late-antique spirit of hermetic or arcane knowledge. Their authors took the magical dimensions of the recipes seriously. Since books of secrets were generally just collections of loosely related advices, their texts were highly unstable. At virtually every copying, a scribe could add or subtract material. For the most part, books of secrets did not have any direct relationship to the university-level science; they were mostly laymen's compendia. The</p>\n<p>The medieval book of secrets developed in two distinct directions, both resulting in books called <em>ricettari</em> in early modern Italy. Books systematically collected for the use of apothecaries and other medical workers could be called with this name, as in the case of the influential <em>Ricettario fiorentino</em>, first published in 1499 and enlarged and frequently reprinted with the sanction of the guild of physicians and spicers into the seventeenth century. These apothecaries' collections were both textbooks for teaching apprentices and also manuals for shop use. They were typically straightforward typographically and largely unadorned.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, extracts from official recipe books and academic sources were combined with folklore to make up little booklets for layfolk also called <em>ricettari</em>. <em>Ricettari</em> of this latter sort became common in Italian cities from the fifteen twenties onward. Since they first appear in print in Italy at just the time when the first handwriting and arithmetic manuals were appearing, it is clear that printers modeled <em>ricettari</em> on small language and math textbooks. Printers offered the newly literate classes as many practical manuals as they could. Almost every booklet offered self-help and each claimed somehow to be \"new,\" though few really broke new ground. Most assumed a deliberately conversational tone that seemed appropriate to their audience.

First of all, there was a long tradition of academic study of music theory in the medieval universities but the actual practice of singing and playing instruments had largely been taught by apprenticeship. In effect, medieval music had been two disciplines, not one. In the fifteenth century, theorists and practitioners made a conscious project of uniting the field, and their efforts, ongoing through the entire sixteenth century, showed up in many elementary texts. Secondly, many different kinds of music books came onto the market across the first hundred years of printing, complicating our understanding of what beginners learned and how. Perhaps more than in other disciplines, the authors of books on music tended to assume their audience would self-select, so they did not label their works in any obvious way for one or another level or type of reader. Together these factors make it hard to judge the audience for many music books.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full//6.00_Chapter_Six/HFS_021.08.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full//6.00_Chapter_Six/HFS_021.08.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Gaffurius 1496 - Humanist philosophy of music (click to enlarge - 855 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Music textbooks had to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Although at times the process seems confused and <em>ad hoc</em>, the sources for any given book are almost always clearly identifiable, and writers usually attempted to be fully systematic by the lights of their own learning. A much larger problem -- for readers of the period and for us too -- was that authors of new works, especially elementary ones, had to contend with two moving targets, or, to extend the metaphor of bridging the gap between practice and theory, they were trying to build a solid span between two floating islands. Performance practices and styles were changing rapidly as popular performers and melodies crisscrossed Europe. Music theory, meanwhile -- inherited from the ancient world, much discussed in the Middle Ages, rediscovered in ancient sources during the fifteenth century -- was the subject of intense debate up to about 1530, making it harder for teachers to adopt a single vocabulary. The place of music in the humanist curriculum was secure, based on both Aristotelian and Neoplatonic authorities, but the details of humanist music instruction seem to have varied from school to school much more than in language disciplines. Most students, moreover, learned music outside of humanist-inspired classrooms, in the song schools that supplied professionals to church choirs in every major town. These students had little use for a classicizing humanist version of music. They needed to learn to read and interpret music on the page.

Advanced music-theory books also had medieval precedents; these were printed in Latin for university-level audiences very early on. Later textbook treatments derived from such academic books; and the textbook authors often had already published at the specialist level. But well into the sixteenth century, it is often not clear when a given writer was popularizing or what audience he envisioned for his book.

The new textbooks were fully typographic creations, not dependent on manuscript formats, and more sophisticated than other textbooks we have discussed in this chapter.</p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/6.00_Chapter_Six/Case-4A-1006-(Vault)-Sagoge-in-mvsicen-Henrici-Glarea,-pg.10v-11r.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/6.00_Chapter_Six/Case-4A-1006-(Vault)-Sagoge-in-mvsicen-Henrici-Glarea,-pg.10v-11r.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">case-4a-1006-vault-sagoge-in-mvsicen-henrici-glarea-pg10v-11r-thumb</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Music textbooks had a distinctive look. Illustrated with diagrams, depictions of instruments, and musical examples, they were more elaborate and expensive than most vernacular school books. Moreover, the visuals were almost never purely ornamental; in most cases they were essential to the teaching function of the books. Some of these textbooks were among the handsomest productions of the Italian presses in the first half of the sixteenth century. Modern scholars have written about them extensively, so it will suffice here to describe a few examples in terms that allow comparison with other textbooks.

Froben was the perfect humanist publisher, a friend of Erasmus and Alciati, with a workshop full of skilled craftsmen who could achieve any look while presenting the greatest literary achievements of humanism in handsome and readable form. His textbooks all followed a severely typographic style, but they also achieved a certain charm by the use of small, elegantly spaced italic types. The origin of this style was Italian --it derived from models provided by Aldo Manuzio-- but Froben applied it to a music book for the first time.

It is possible that Aaron's printer and others at the period had in mind the model offered by Glareanus's *Isagoge *or more recent textbooks like the pretty pocket books published for the Lutheran Christian schools by Georg Rhaw.

(92)</p>\n<p>The principal rival to Bonaventura's <em>Breviloquium</em> on the Italian market at the turn of the sixteenth century was an anonymously compiled <em>Compendium musices</em> that received several editions between 1499 and 1509. It is less well organized than the <em>Breviloquium</em>, merely a series of observations on basic music theory that might be useful to singers. It may have been intended more for choirmasters than for simple choristers, a supposition confirmed by its subsequent history. After 1509 it appeared in print more than twenty five times, but only as a preface to other, more extensive handbooks for liturgists.</p>\n<p>From 1513 to 1566 it was often printed in combination with the Cantorinus, a small, cheaply printed collection of specimen chants (primarily initial and final phrases) for use on various feast days throughout the year. From 1523 onward, the <em>Compendium</em> was also included in the <em>Rituale</em>, a large reference book of prayers and chants. (93) Both the <em>Compendium musices</em> and the <em>Breviloquium</em> of Bonaventura were practical texts for clerics who sang professionally. Neither had any pretensions to teach music theory as a cultural ornament.</p>\n<p>A similar audience, though perhaps one more open to humanist ideals, was intended for the <em>Sparks of Music</em> by Giovanni Maria Lanfranco (ca. 1490-1545), published at Brescia in 1533. This work does not seem to have been influential; but it was a real textbook for singers -- simple, step-by-step instructions with good examples for practice. Lanfranco dressed his book with elaborate front matter that claimed a classical pedigree for his teachings, but the remaining one hundred forty four pages are strictly matter of fact. Tellingly, he deliberately wrote not in Latin or literary Tuscan, but in \"the universal Italian speech\" (an all-purpose North-Italian amalgam), \"in order not to offend the ears of most with some words spoken in too Tuscan a fashion.\" More self-consciously than any earlier music writer, Lanfranco identified his audience as beginners.

Books that concerned instrumental practice often seem to have been aimed at amateur students or their teachers. Books on plainchant were clearly directed to professionals, though often performers of no great sophistication. Polyphony books almost always concern compositional norms as well as performance, and so we may assume that they were usually intended for professional musicians.

He published a short manual for student choristers in 1609. He labeled it clearly as a popularization, <em>The Rules Most Necessary as an Introduction to Plainchant</em>. His readers were beginners, or at any rate not highly skilled or well informed. His dedication described an audience exactly like that named by Bonaventura da Brescia in 1497, \"poor churchfolk and others desirous of learning the basics of chant,\" but he elaborated on their poverty by saying that many choristers worked like blind men, to whom he hoped his booklet would bring light. (104) Cerone was even more explicit about the limitations of a song-school education in the afterward to his book, where he provided a long list of things he had not covered in his <em>Regole</em>. The list concluded, \"and many other minor things too, which I think are not as necessary to a simple chorister as they are useful to the perfect choirmaster.

Eventually it would be read widely in Spain and even in New Spain. (106) For such an audience, music was both a professional discipline and a cultural ornament worth studying in depth. It was also an integral part of a newly emerging international high culture. The new literature, art, and music were vernacular and international, but not univesalizing in the old Latinate sense. International use no longer depended exclusively on the old universal language, Latin, but could also be achieved multi-lingually, by employing sophisticated vernaculars with wide currency among cultured folk in many countries -- Tuscan Italian, Castillian Spanish, or the French of Paris.

They all embodied skills of urban citizens, whether elite, middling, or artisanal, for whom the ornament of traditional Latin learning was less important than knowledge that led to success in government, business, or the arts broadly understood. This was true even for music textbooks, for musicians were skilled professionals who sold their services to make a living. Increasingly they depended for patronage on urban aristocrats who also cultivated music as amateurs. The wealth of these patrons was business-based; they valued music mathematically just as they did such other mathematically based skills as accounting, surveying, and navigation. As Alfred W. Crosby has ably shown, the music and painting of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were supremely mathematical disciplines, perfectly suited to the quantifying spirit of the age. Each of the new skills was provided with a rhetoric -- largely independent of traditional Latin rhetoric -- that legitimized a new order of society in which fully moral success was possible in business. (108)</p>\n<p>What is more, all these disciplines were in themselves businesslike, precisely because they partook of quantification and the accuracy it demanded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The dictionary defines <em>businesslike</em> as efficient, concise, direct, systematic and thorough. Nothing about courageous or elegant or pious, terms the noble or priestly classes might claim for themselves. <em>Businesslike</em> means careful and meticulous and, in practice, is a matter of numbers. It was one of the trails that led to science and technology insofar as its practitioners were quantitative in their perception and manipulation of as much of experience as could be described in quanta. (109)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Crosby here is pointing to a fundamental shift in <em>mentalitÃ©</em>, one that would lead away from the worldview of Christian humanism. The authors of vernacular textbooks started down this path by claiming a moral and intellectual high ground that had once belonged only to the clergy and ennunciating a nobility of purpose that had once been aristocratic and humanistic. Slowly, arts and crafts, manufacturing and shipping, trade and banking came to be both honorable and virtuous callings with professional literatures of their own. Eventually this shift in mentality would lead to a new political and social order worldwide. The European imperial adventure was not merely another Latinizing imitation of the Roman Empire; it was also a conquest of the natural world and the triumph of Western, quantifying culture.</p>\n<p>Vernacular learning was the future of education and of educational publishing. Competitive vernaculars, embodied in nation states, would require textbooks that were better suited to the new realities of European commerce and conquest than the universalizing Latin textbooks of the past. It would be centuries before the kinds of textbooks made for the Latin classroom would be obsolete, but already at the start of the sixteenth century the monopolistic grip of the Latin master was beginning to weaken. Vernacular high culture on the one hand and widely-available self-help and how-to literature on the other would slowly lessen the need for Latin learning. Of course, printers and publishers were more than willing to profit from the new learning even as they obediently created books that served the older order. They were businesslike too, after all.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(108)Â  Crosby 1997, 139-197; see also Van Egmond 1986, 53-59; Carruthers and Nelson-Espeland 1991, 34-36, 60-64; Cormack and Mazzio 2005, 95-113.</li>\n<li>(109)Â  Crosby 1997, 200.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Vernacular textbooks of the sort we have described in this chapter have one important thing in common.

Many of these changes, however, were effected not by the demands of the technology itself but rather for the sake of marketing books. Similarly, the demands of a universal, moral pedagogy influenced both the content and form of new school books. In this chapter, we will consider a genre of book new in the sixteenth century that, perhaps more than any other, united the moral impulse with the marketing one. This was the emblem book, born of humanist recreation in making up playful analogies, but quickly taken up by publishers who marketed it as a tool for moral education.</p>\n<p>Moral-analogical thinking was essential to the medieval pedagogy which Renaissance school masters inherited and sought to reform. For Christian educators, every individual act had its analogue in the larger world, either in the present, through history, or in literary fact. In the age of print this belief was communicated in a variety of typographic dress and sometimes took the form of outlines, tables, diagrams, or illustrations which could be facilitated by the new technologies of relief printing and engraving. But no Renaissance pedagogue seriously challenged either the moral content of elementary and intermediate education or the fruitfulness of the analogical method. (1) On the contrary, the perceived urgency of moral education increased in the course of the long sixteenth century in response to political intrigues, religious wars, and the rising status of the commercial classes relative to that of the traditional noble and clerical elites. Educators of all classes clung to old-fashioned morals amidst a storm of social instability.</p>\n<p>By contrast to such conservatism, the marketing strategies applied to mass-produced books were genuine novelties. Title pages, prefaces, and colophons offered new rhetorical <em>topoi</em> on reading and study and variants on old ones. They also promoted new, consumerist behaviors with respect to books. The very fact of mass production acted to commodify books; advertising claims followed closely behind. In many forms and on many subjects, textbooks served to educate consumers in the new market behaviors as well as in the traditional skills of the Latin-school course.</p>\n<p>Another invention of the sixteenth century, closely tied both to marketing and to visually presented moral analogy, was the emblem book, which we may define most simply as a collection of picture-puzzles. In an emblem, a striking picture is accompanied by a motto and a poem or two, sometimes in several languages, typically with the intent of embodying several layers of meaning. Each emblem was a free-standing object, usually presented on a single page or single page opening. The emblem book was a collection of individual emblems, sometimes systematically organized, often not. It could have one theme or many, but almost always it claimed to have a moral purpose. Emblem books have generated an enormous critical literature in the last half century, but there are few accounts that explain how and why the emblem book came to be a popular educational tool even though it had no place in traditional classrooms. (2)</p>\n<p>The emblem form was popular throughout Europe but reached its greatest sophistication as a teaching tool not in Italy but in Northern Europe. In this chapter, then, our survey of sixteenth-century Italian textbooks will conclude by considering some teaching tools that were neither specifically Italian nor properly speaking textbooks. Still, despite their non-Italian pedigree, emblems and emblem books were quintessentially sixteenth-century, printerly inventions which pointed to the future of education. They served during most of our period to educate the public both to morals and to methods of reading and thinking. They offered a new way of visualizing moral problems. The emblem was in part a response by humanists to the nascent, alternative educational system of practical / technical training. Although emblems were often vernacular or multi-lingual as well as Latin, they represented for the most part a novel way of presenting the wisdom of classical Christianity (what Alfred W. Crosby calls the Venerable Model) to a broad new public. The potential of emblems as teaching tools was immense. Examining them will show where textbook publishing was headed by the time the long sixteenth century passed into the age of enlightenment.</p>\n<p>We will also discover that book workers -- from authors and editors to scribes, typesetters, and printers -- embraced emblematic thinking as a way of bridging the ethical distance between commerce and science, between textbook making and teaching. Although it is clear from their advertising that humanists accepted and even embraced the market model of book making and distribution, the printing revolution was not achieved without creating tensions in establishmentarian thought. In particular, humanists often portrayed printers as technicians run amok, automatically reproducing massive numbers of errors and infelicities that would pass unnoticed or do no permanent harm in a more natural oral / aural classroom situation. Emblematic printer's marks served to smooth over the difference between commercial and learned goals by situating publishers' aspirations within the framework of humanist morals. By including an emblematic printer's mark, book makers and sellers embedded humanist modes of thought into many books and pamphlets they offered. Teachers in turn adopted this emblematic manner of labeling to advertise their own learning in and outside classrooms.

Both the form of the individual emblem and the idea of creating a collection of them were devised as a literary recreation for his humanist friends (including a number of printers) by a renowned professor of law, Andrea Alciati (1492-1550). The moment was December of 1522. His collection went to print in 1531 without his consent. It was imitated almost immediately, and by the 1540s the new genre was established and flourishing entirely outside of Alciati's control and indeed in forms he had not imagined. Alciati's long, international career as literary editor and translator and as teacher of law at Avignon, Milan, Bourges, Pavia, Bologna, and Ferrara no doubt contributed to the successful marketing of his emblem book, which saw hundreds of editions in a dozen languages within his lifetime.

He specifically mentions the mark of Aldo Manuzio, which, as he knew, had been explicated at some length by Erasmus in his <em>Adagia</em>.

He did not promote or supervise the earliest editions. Emblem collections for the entertainment and edification of a broader public were market objects invented by printers. The market drove further development of the form, which is analogous in this regard to successful collections of proverbs that often supplied the emblematists' mottoes. Both proverb collections and emblem books were complex, mimetic forms, derived from commonplaces in earlier literature and aimed at inviting the creation of additional commonplaces. The emblem book easily changed and grew well beyond the author's control because the form was composite; printed emblems required an artist to complement the work of the author. (6)</p>\n<p>Emblems were offered as learning tools for children and adults alike. The published genre was not specifically school-oriented, but we know that painted and printed emblems often appeared in schools. Alciati composed his emblems in the context of learned rhetorical culture (by definition Latin-literate) but his emblems were translated and adapted for children within only a few years of their first publication. At the end of the sixteenth century devising emblems became part of the standard Jesuit school curriculum. By the middle of the seventeenth century emblems and emblematic thinking were almost universal in Europe. Education to this mode of thinking was by then a common part of the Latin curriculum and became formalized in several ways outside the Latin schools.</p>\n<p>Like the textbook market, however, the emblem market allowed for many regional variations of taste and practice. Courtly and academic emblems were published throughout Europe. The form was rapidly adopted by Christian evangelists of many denominations, but secular emblem books also continued to be made in some markets. In Protestant Europe, emblem books were published specifically for a children's market, giving rise to an early genre of children's literature (as distinct from textbooks for school use). But emblem books for children, whether in or out of school, were never common in Italy. And the emblem book did not have a fixed place in the curriculum on either side of the Alps. American publishers today refer to some such books as \"ancillaries,\" that is, books that can be built into certain curricula as designed by educational publishers but which are also marketed and read separately. It is useful to imagine the emblem book having this function in early modern schools too, as a supplementary teaching tool that some teachers integrated closely into their curricula, while others did not use it at all.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(4)Â  Manning 2002, 42-45 ; Wolkenhauer 2002, 55, 207-208; Grendler 2002a, 439-443; Alciati, ed.

A few examples will show how this was so. The simplest emblems make us think immediately of classroom reading exercises, even though we know they were not originally intended for that purpose. In Alciati's Emblem 126, under the motto \"From one man's loss, another's gain\" (<em>Ex damno alterius alterius utilitas</em>), the reader is invited to imagine a lioness and a boar in mortal combat while a vulture sits watchfully in a nearby tree. The poem describes the action in simple verse, deliberately rustic in style and reminiscent of an Aesopian fable. The final line, again after the fashion of Aesop, offers an epigrammatic saying or moral, \"The trophy of the victor will be another's [the vulture's] plunder.\" (7) This moral, however, was the second one given to the reader, since he had already been told in the motto that one man's loss produces another's gain. Equally deliberately, the story is a little more complex than Alciati's rustic style or either pithy saying alone allowed. The attentive reader would notice that there were two winners and one loser in the story, while the motto described one winner and one loser, and the moral epigram named the two winners but merely implied a loser.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full//7.00_Chapter_Seven/HFS_028.01.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full//7.00_Chapter_Seven/HFS_028.01.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Lion and Boar (click to enlarge - 505 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>The printed image could complicate the reading of the emblem or simplify it. In Alciati's first emblems, there were no visuals, only the poems and mottoes. One of the pleasures of the puzzle --something that recommended it as a pastime-- was that the poem invited the reader to visualize the scene for himself. In the case of an animal fable like that of the lioness, boar, and vulture this process did not in fact require much imagination since the animals in question had a familiar iconography. A printed emblem complete with image was puzzling in a different way, since the reader might not at first see how the meaning of the motto at the top of the page related to the picture. In the visual dynamic of the printed emblem, motto and picture are captured by the eye at once, but only carefully reading the poem in a second moment could resolve the tension between motto and image. Emblem 126 of the lioness and boar comes from the second published collection of Alciati's emblems, offered by the Aldine press in 1546. By this time, Alciati's earlier collection had been in print for fifteen years and the learned inventor knew that his new emblems would be presented with images. The result in this case of an animal fable was a simple, clearly described image easily translated by the artist.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full//7.00_Chapter_Seven/HFS_028.02.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full//7.00_Chapter_Seven/HFS_028.02.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Obscure and complex (click to enlarge - 507 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Many of Alciati's emblems, however, were less naturalistic in form and lent themselves less easily both to visualization and to reading. Emblem 16 in modern editions is also from the 1546 collection and is among the more mysterious, at least on the face of it. Certainly it requires a complex reading. The picture shows an enormous, disembodied hand floating over a rural landscape. In some versions the artist dotted the fields with flowers; in others, a single oversize flower floats alongside the hand. On the open palm of the hand, an eye stares out at the viewer. The motto appeared in both Greek and Latin, telling the reader at once that the author had found an interesting Greek text and was going to translate it both literally and into an emblem. The Latin translation was unusually wordy for Alciati; it exhorted the reader to be careful, not to believe too easily, for \"these are the limbs of the mind\" (<em>haec sunt membra mentis</em>). No reader could be expected to resolve the enigma posed by the image and motto with any degree of certainty unless he could also get some hints from the poem. Even then, the reader was made to work. The entire poem reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do not be credulous, do not be incautious, says Epicharmus. These will be the sinews and limbs of the human mind. Behold a hand with an eye, believing what it sees. Behold the pennyroyal flower, ancient symbol of sobriety. By displaying it [the flower] Heraclitus calmed the crowd and charmed it, though it was threatening with swelling sedition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full//7.00_Chapter_Seven/HFS_027.02.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full//7.00_Chapter_Seven/HFS_027.02.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Obscurity explained (click to enlarge - 695 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>This poem is not entirely self-explanatory, but at least it identifies the source of the quotation, tells an ancient story (which is <em>not</em> pictured), and gives a token meaning to the items that are in the picture, the pennyroyal and the odd, seeing hand. The functional dynamic of the emblem, however, can only be explained in terms of Renaissance memory theory, which held that a striking, if possible slightly weird image was easier to remember than an ordinary one. Indeed, the full force of the emblem depends on memory in several ways. The reader must first remember at least vaguely the story of Heraclitus. She or he must be willing to accept a miscellaneous grouping of objects as a memory device. It would help too if the reader had a good memory for Latin vocabulary and knew that the adjective <em>oculata</em> (here applied to the hand) often referred to eyewitnesses in a court room. A person who offered reliable testimony by distinction to mere hearsay was <em>oculatus</em>. At this level, the emblem required multi-level, retrospective reading. It was intended to provoke a strenuous exercise of memory and moral analogy, both personal and historical.

John Manning has related how Alciati's Emblem 110 proved difficult for artists; it appeared in the first printed collection of 1531 with a picture that is entirely inappropriate to the poem. The image is that of Amor, and the poem asks a series of questions, wondering where are the love god's bow, arrows, torch, and wings. It adds, why does he hold three garlands and wear another on his brow? As Manning notes, Alciati was inviting his reader to imagine a child or youth without any of the usual attributes of Cupid/Amor; but the earliest editions offered a standard-issue cupid with bow, arrows, and wings.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full//7.00_Chapter_Seven/HFS_026.03.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full//7.00_Chapter_Seven/HFS_026.03.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Wrong Love, 1540 (click to enlarge - 865 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Apparently the highly standardized iconography interfered with a proper understanding of the verse, for the mysterious lack of attributes was made perfectly clear in the second half of the poem when the god himself replies that he is not promoting venereal love but love of virtue, that his laurel crown represents wisdom, and that he is weaving garlands of the other virtues. The motto also pointed in this direction, since it is \"Love of virtue\" (<em>Amor virtutis</em>). It took several editions prepared with advice from Alciati to fully correct the error.</p>\n<p>Exactly the reverse iconographical drift occurred with Emblem 6, False Religion (<em>Ficta religio</em>). Early editions correctly showed an enthroned prostitute who offers the wine of delusion to her followers. Later in the century, the poem's passing reference to Babylon led artists to imagine the biblical whore of Babylon and show Alciati's strumpet seated on the seven-headed monster common in images of the Apocalypse.

Even straightforward emblems, however, were susceptible to multiple readings and indeed demanded them. In the emblem adopted as a trademark by the Medici Oriental Press, for example, the reader is presented with an image of a hand reaching out from a cloud and sowing grain onto a recently plowed field. The plow, apparently just abandoned by the plowman, sits atilt at the bottom of the frame. The accompanying Latin motto reads, \"Rejoicing, they will gather the harvest.\" (10) In the then-current Italian fashion, and because this is a trademark as well as an emblem, there was no accompanying poem, so the relationship between motto and image was left to the viewer to figure out. The motto does not refer directly to the scene of plowing and sowing but to the far-off harvest. Since the Medici Oriental Press was a missionary effort devoted to presenting catechetical texts in oriental languages, the verbal/visual device here had a specific meaning with reference to Christian missionary efforts. But it was open-ended enough to be read more generally of the fruitfulness of hard work, something appropriate to any printing house and, indeed, to most areas of Christian life.</p>\n<p>Almost all emblems are based on literary sources and imply a comparative reading of texts on related themes. (11) In this example, there was no exact verbal parallel for the motto about the harvest in either the Old or New Testament, but the author deliberately evoked scriptural language (that of the gospel parables in particular); and the saying easily suggested a whole range of moral readings. The emblem as a whole embodied more of the related biblical stories than either the single image of sowing or the motto about reaping could offer. So the reader was presented with two themes commonplace in themselves but slightly different from any in scripture, that labor is its own reward and that joy is a precondition for as well as the result of fruitful work.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(9)Â  Manning 1989, 129-134; Manning 2002, 51-54, 277-279.</li>\n<li>(10)Â  <em>In exultatione metent</em>.

Collected into books with numerous images, the individual emblems became even more open-ended, since they invited the reader to conceive of study as a series of discrete problems which added up to a moral philosophy, personally acquired and personally applied. Admittedly, the intent was establishmentarian. The individual puzzles almost always led to commonplace solutions that were dictated by obvious social standards. The themes were those of European society at large; and the most significant single lesson intended by most authors was the value of conforming to the commonplaces. Indeed, conformity was an increasingly urgent emblem theme as the Wars of Religion progressed. Still, emblems required an activist kind of reading that engaged the mind in problem solving. The emblem book did not allow of passive learning or rote memorization. It could elicit a variety of responses. The mental activism it demanded particularly appealed to teachers, just as the overall lessons of conformity to authority did. (12)</p>\n<p>Because they were pictorial, emblems also assumed some kind of display, both of the complex, invented objects and of the author's learnedness which stood behind the images, mottoes, and poems. There were many everyday opportunities to display emblems, but the emblem book rather quickly became the usual way to transmit emblems to the public. It is easy to see how this kind of public/private, learned/popular, esoteric/on-display object came to symbolize Renaissance ideals of moral education and rhetorical/scientific invention. At their most pretentious, emblem authors imagined that long study and experience were distilled into a single, revelatory moment embodied in the emblem. The emblem would both explicate an author's insight and also stand permanently as witness to the genius of the inventor. In practice very few emblems \"invented\" in the modern sense of the word. Instead, they discovered morally persuasive themes in the literature of the past -- the classical, rhetorical sense of <em>inventio</em> -- and this was exactly the goal traditionally claimed for a good Latin education. It is in this important sense that emblem collections can be seen as a humanist response to the new realities of education through printed tools. Once collected into series, emblems in book form served for meditation and for teaching, but also for the processes of rhetorical invention and other sorts of design. They were how-to books for inventive thought, whether moral, graphic, or scientific. Because they were puzzles, emblems presupposed a leisurely, Latinate sort of reading and study, not the kinds of simple amusement, quick reference, or stepwise directive that was the method of the usual vernacular how-to book. (13)</p>\n<p>The printed emblem book flourished as a high-culture phenomenon until about 1600. Starting in the mid-sixteenth century, however, and continuing throughout the seventeenth, the form was popularized. This developmental arc is important, because the form rather quickly became something its inventor never imagined. Already in the late sixteenth century, emblem-making was diffused into a variety of everyday life situations and popularized. Printing played a key role, both by multiplying the individual emblems and also by proposing the emblem book as tool for extended meditation. The emblem book elevated the activity of composing and puzzling out individual emblems from an occasional pastime to a literary genre with its own rules and conventions, its own critical literature, and a series of audiences defined by the market. Some emblems had always had moral meaning, but, increasingly in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, moral emblems in book form were offered to women and children as tools for learning how to conform to the expectations of society. The process began very early, with several translations of Alciati's 1531 collection intended for student readers that appeared in France in the 1540s.

Still, the possibility that some were used in classrooms at an early date cannot be excluded. The emblem of the pelican widely associated with Vittorino da Feltre (1378-1446), for example, suggests that he and his successors presented such literary images to boys in his famous school at Mantua. (16) We can be sure that emblems in the form of printer's marks did arrive in classrooms on the title pages of school books. So, even before a student encountered an emblem book, that is, a systematic collection of emblems, he or she would have encountered the emblem form repeatedly. Emblem books were just a way of owning the genre personally. They made the educational activity of reading complex symbols into an object to buy on the market.</p>\n<p>Sixteenth-century children probably learned to read emblems actively for the first time in the advertising context we have already explored in earlier chapters, namely the front matter, especially the title pages, of their school books. (See especially sections 1.06, 1.10, 1.14, and 2.08.) By the end of the sixteenth century, when popular prints and posters of all sorts were to be found on display everywhere in European cities, they could also read such emblems in the</p>\n<p>Medieval European towns boasted a welter of pictorial shop signs. Early modern streets and shops were also increasingly cluttered with printed posters or broadsides announcing everything from royal and municipal laws to the latest news events to public ceremonies and even private ones like christenings, weddings, and funerals. The communicative problem in any poster is to attract members of the target public and keep them standing long enough to get the message.

It gave the details of a celebratory mass, offered some poetry on its devotional subject, and named the sponsors of the events. The design challenge in such a poster was to make present to a varied public the meaning of an abstract religious doctrine. At the center of the poster is an engraved emblem of the wounds, displaying in solemn fashion the tools of torture. Devotion to the wounds of Christ was a common late medieval practice that would have been familiar to many relatively unschooled folk. (18) The version in this Roman poster of 1671, however, was somewhat removed from popular, late medieval iconography. The wounds themselves were not depicted, only the instruments --the nails, lance, scourge, and crown of thorns. Many popular images, moreover, included the sign affixed to the cross that read \"Behold the King of the Jews,\" the mocking words that were at once a part of the torture and a prophesy of the triumph of Christ.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/7.00_Chapter_Seven/Case-Wing-+ZC-93.185,-Italian-Festival-Posters-342-DETAIL.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/7.00_Chapter_Seven/Case-Wing-+ZC-93.185,-Italian-Festival-Posters-342-DETAIL.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Words inside the picture</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Here we find instead a different verbalization, one that tells us we are to take the image emblematically as well as literally. An elegant banderole woven into the crown of thorns displays the motto <em>Plaga plagis curatur</em>, or \"The blow is cured by blows.\" Other texts on the poster include the names and titles of the noble patron of the feast and an original but unlovely sonnet on the wounds. Note, however, that the longer texts <em>do not explicate</em> the emblem any more than the motto does; these texts merely accompany the image and contextualize it. Some of the words here are strictly information, telling us when and where the solemn mass would be celebrated; others are more celebratory and ornamental. As is usual in emblems, the motto is an essential part of the puzzle. It does not label or explain the picture; rather, it offers one clue to the puzzle represented by the emblem as a whole.</p>\n<p>The emblematic symbol of the theological doctrine being celebrated on this feast day is by far the most prominent element on the poster even though the text is fulsome and the layout is complicated by other visuals (borders, <em>putti</em>, flowers).

Even when the educational aims were heavy-handedly moralistic, and even when the creators of the works ostentatiously talked down to their audiences, the resulting graphic objects were rarely simplistic. They were multi-layered by design. Their puzzle-like nature derived directly from pedagogical theory that insisted upon multiplicity of meaning.

Oxford University Press with its heraldic mark on the spine and title page, or even its name just spoken, has a cachet some other imprints do not. As we move into the age of electronic publishing, with less extensive peer review and less stability for texts in circulation, we are reverting to a situation like that of the early title page, when the maker's mark was not always a recognized guarantee. The early modern printer's mark was something you had to stop and read, whether you encountered it in a bookshop, in a library, or in a classroom. It was a hallmark of quality, but one that had to be evaluated on a continuing basis. Its ability to function as a hallmark, that is, depended on a public of readers educated to understand the emblem and willing to take the time to puzzle it out.</p>\n<p>The habit of claiming intellectual high ground in printer's marks elicited at least one negative critique in the sixteenth century. Johann Arnold of Marktbergel (fl. 1515-1547) published a poem in 1540 in praise of the marvelous invention of printing. Like Erasmus in the later editions of the <em>Adagia</em>, Arnold recognized that the glorious intellectual achievements of his age were both promoted by printers like Aldo Manuzio and counterfeited by other, less scrupulous men. Erasmus and Arnold assigned the blame to profit seeking; and both pointed up the hypocrisy embodied in the high-culture pretension of printer's marks. (25) Arnold was far more direct in his criticism than Erasmus. One of the printed marginal rubrics to Arnold's poem was \"On printers' marks\"(<em>De typographorum insigniis</em>), and the poem went right to the point with more than one <em>double entendre</em>: \"The present age sells/praises reputations/symbols on books, and puts them for all to see right at first sight/on the title page\" (<em>Vendicat ac praesens aetas insignia libris / Et prima facie conspicienda locat</em>). Arnold quickly dispensed with the ambiguity of such wordplay and launched into a bitter complaint about the misuse of complex and often obscure classical symbols to sell shoddy goods. Even Delphian Apollo could not figure some of them out. The passage ends:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every [printer] hopes he will shed favorable light on his books with this kind of deceit, and he expects dishonest profit thereby. But what the image displayed on paper actually shows is its owner's everlasting negation of his own good deeds. No one offers a symbol of virtue; no one takes up just arms in the hand of Justice. (26)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The significant wordplay here is in that <em>usque</em> (continuing, everlasting) -- the durability of the mark on paper is compared to the eternity of the printer's damnation.</p>\n<p>Perhaps it was just too much to expect commerce and humanism to mix easily in the confined space of a title page. Still, Arnold was in the minority. Most other writers on emblematic printer's marks were less critical. They praise the printers who live up to the intellectual pretensions of their marks. Even Erasmus, who complained long and bitterly about the greed of printers, did so in the context of his explication of the mark of a printer he admired. Arnold, by contrast, fixed on the marks as symbols of hypocrisy. His depth of feeling cannot be denied. It attests to the real influence such emblems were thought to have for teaching good --or for embodying evil.

That is, they combined informational and moral import in individual images that were surrounded by type but usually not closely explicated in the adjacent text. Commercial or advertising motives were never absent but they did not usually function alone, if only because the emblematic mode of thinking encouraged readers to look for more than one level of meaning. The presence of the image was an invitation to think on more than one level, to add imaginative value, if you will, to the textual content. (20)</p>\n<p>All these meanings were present in printer's marks even before Alciati invented the emblem as such. Not incidentally, they were just beginning to be a regular feature of title pages about the time Alciati imagined the literary genre. In her book on the development of the early title page, Margaret Smith distinguishes between the protective value of a cover sheet, its labeling value, and its function as a sales tool. (21) If we recall that sophisticated book buyers in the fifteenth century approached any page with the expectation of multiple meanings, it comes as no surprise that these several functions worked simultaneously. Putting a printer's mark on the title page added yet another marketing function and another level of sophisticated consumer expectation. Even if the mark were merely ornamental or functioned primarily as a hallmark ensuring quality, its presence was already an addition of sorts, signifying a certain quality of manufactured object. If it was also an emblem of the kind educated readers were trained to puzzle out, then it recommended the book in intellectual and moral as well as other consumer terms.</p>\n<p>It is well worth asking how these design-oriented motives went along with the literary, moral, commercial, and practical ones. Emblems were puzzles, and puzzling them out was considered a sort of invention. Invention still had a strongly rhetorical meaning in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It always meant inventing arguments or finding them out in the raw materials of a subject. In the case of emblems it also meant encoding them in symbols that could be unlocked in a second moment by another inventor. As such the emblem participated in a sort of retrospective or reflexive design process. From the start, the maker of an emblem expected that it would be the subject of intellectual back-formations on the part of its readers. The act of devising or inventing images and the act of decoding them were not just technical skills. They were moral acts, fruitful applications of mental skill to problem solving, and practice in making and effecting moral decisions. (22)</p>\n<p>Adding an emblem to the title page in the form of a printer's mark (or, less commonly, the personal emblem of the book's author or that of a scholarly academy) usually had more to do with the authority of the product than its subject. It was validation, not information. It invited the reader to take the book seriously. The emblematic mark also embedded in every text from a given press the multi-layered meanings of the emblem, whether they had anything to do with the specific content of the book or not. (23) Claude Mignault, a late sixteenth-century theorist of the emblem, pointed to this specific function of the emblematic printer's mark:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... I must add a few words about the emblems of certain learned men of the press which they are accustomed to add ingeniously to the title pages of their books, and by which they encourage themselves either by genius or by design, to do those things necessary for the cultivation of better letters. (24)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus the emblematic mark is both an ingenious device or company logo and a way for the printers to encourage themselves and others to do their best for the republic of letters.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(20)Â  Schilling 1990, 288-292; Henkel 2000, 210-213, 237-243.</li>\n<li>(21)Â  Smith 2000a.</li>\n<li>(22)Â  For the design process, Peponis et al. 2002, 75-88; Gehl 2002, 104-105; further on psychology, Gareffi 1981, 12-17; Scholz 2002, 303-305; on marketing aspects, Sabbioneta 2003, 16-36.</li>\n<li>(23)Â  Compagnon 1979, 262-267; Pinkus 1996, 75-88.</li>\n<li>(24) Mignault 1571 quoted by Wolkenhauer 2002, 90: <em>... quorundam rei Typographicae peritorum hominumn huc adiiciam eiconas, quibus ingeniose uti soleant in suorum libris fontispiciis, quibus se vel ingenio, vel arte, meliorum litterarum adiumento necessaria commendent.</em></li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"In design terms, popular products like posters functioned very much like the emblematic title pages on books.

The Aldine anchor-and-dolphin mark was one of a particular sort, where the image required the compliment of a motto, in this case <em>Festina lente</em> (\"Make haste slowly\"), but the motto was never displayed along with the mark. Such emblems with implied but not stated mottoes were common and intended to add a further dimension to the puzzle-like nature of the device. In the specific case of Aldo, the mysterious mark on so many schoolbooks not only identified the products of the Aldine press, it also invited discussion and explication.

The typical printer chose an emblem with both an image and a motto that could be read and interpreted fairly easily.

The mark of the Medici Oriental Press described above is of this sort. There was a great deal of visual/verbal word play in the book trade, which served in the market to commend the books to those who thought of themselves as witty.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full//7.00_Chapter_Seven/HFS_031.01.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full//7.00_Chapter_Seven/HFS_031.01.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Mr. Pozzo's mark (click to enlarge - 552 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>When Francesco Moscheni of Milan put a tiny fly (<em>mosca</em>) in the middle of a mark that concerned other, weightier matters, he was just looking for a smile of recognition. Similarly, a play on the name of the Spanish Viceroy by another Milan printer was an elegant compliment that recognized a patron. On the other hand, when Cesare Pozzo included a title page emblem of Christ meeting the woman of Samaria at Jacob's well (<em>pozzo</em>), he was both punning and also making a serious statement about his evangelical religious stance. No motto was needed, for Jesus's speech on the living water of salvation was one of the most quoted passages in all of the New Testament. (29)</p>\n<p>By the middle of the sixteenth century, it was essential for printers to display marks, and emblematic marks were the most common form. Only a few genres of printed matter were exempt. In government printing the arms of a town or ruler could take the place of a printer's mark. Pamphlets or handbills with no expectation of permanence also went without marks. These were the cheapest literary products on the market -- ballads, burlesques, and simple how-to books. Inevitably, heterodox or politically radical works also lacked marks (or employed false ones). The printer's mark on all other works assured buyers of the piety, good faith, respectability, and economic stability of the press. As the century wore on, religious conformity and even Counter-Reformation zeal were increasingly embodied in printer's marks as well. (30)</p>\n<p>Sometimes these thoroughly Christian and bourgeois qualities were not quite enough. The case of Bernardo Giunta shows how this could be so. Bernardo was a third-generation printer from a prominent family that had branches in Florence, Venice, Burgos, and Lyon. He headed the Florence house from 1517 to 1551. All the Giunta affiliates used some form of the fleur-de-lis as their mark. It was the device of the Florentine Republic, and so displayed their pride in Florence as well as in their family traditions. The lily was not in itself an emblematic device. It represented a slightly older tradition of printer's marks, closer in design logic to a coat of arms or a traditional merchant's hallmark. Bernardo himself, however, favored a version which had been transformed into an emblem. His lily was supported by two <em>putti</em> holding vines emerging from a vase; the sometime motto was <em>Nil candidius</em> (\"None more brilliant\" or \"None more famous,\" in effect, \"None better\"). This mark had moral and literary pretensions but it could as easily be read as pure advertising, a sort of product endorsement.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full//7.00_Chapter_Seven/HFS_030.01.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full//7.00_Chapter_Seven/HFS_030.01.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">More than just a lily (click to enlarge - 249 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Apparently, <em>Nil candidius</em> did not suffice for Grand Duke Cosimo I (1519-1574). He wanted Florence's oldest and most productive press to work to the highest standards of scholarly printing in Europe. With his sanction, the court poet and cultural impresario Vincenzo Borghini (1515-1580) pressured an aging and apparently reluctant Bernardo to acquire better type and equipment and to adopt a new, emblematic printer's mark devised by Borghini himself. The new mark would conform to the highest expectations of emblematists and the greatest pretensions of printers. With it, Borghini and the Duke exhorted still greater effort from Bernardo and advertised Florence's claims to be a European cultural capital. From 1547 until his death in 1551, Bernardo's title pages displayed a finely wrought image of a snake shedding its skin between two rocks. Behind and above the serpent rose an elegant, naturalistic lily to reflect Giunta tradition. But the motto, <em>Novus exorior</em> (\"I arise renewed\"), referred only to the snake. In Borghini's own words, the motto \"yields the meaning of a book that with extreme care and labor, as if rubbed between two stones, has left behind the skin of old errors and negligences that once weighed it down.\" For his compliance, Bernardo was rewarded with a noble title, but his heirs continued to use the new device only until 1559. Thereafter they reverted to a stylized fleur-de-lis more in keeping with family tradition.

Cafaro was a native of Salerno who proposed a radically simplified Latin grammar course. The book had considerable success, since it went through more than twenty subsequent editions and was printed as late as 1607. (32) Cafaro intended the phoenix in his title to suggest that his new grammar would replace those of older-fashioned pedagogues; and he emphasized the point on the title page of the first edition with an emblem, apparently cut to order by an unskilled local craftsman. It shows a phoenix rising from the flames and facing the sun with a motto, \"It strives toward the clear light in a star-producing heaven.\" (33) Cafaro, at this date a minor figure anywhere but in Cortona, could only have commanded this degree of consideration from a provincial printer; and the roughness of the cut suggests that the printer could only secure the services of a local artisan.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/7.00_Chapter_Seven/EvenzioPico.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/7.00_Chapter_Seven/EvenzioPico.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Pico's custom-made title page (Photo: ANSAS, Florence) (click to enlarge - 702 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>If a school master had the means to subsidize the publication of a textbook entirely by himself, he could also dictate the title page design to include his own personal mark. Evenzio Pico, a grammarian who taught at Ancona, turned to Antonio Blado in Rome for a beautifully designed elementary grammar that appeared in 1560 together with some shorter works --letters and orations-- authored by Pico. Although Blado used somewhat worn type, the format and layout are spacious and handsome, entirely up to the design standards of his firm. Most remarkable of all, however, is the large, fresh woodcut emblem on the title page. It is a personal mark, not a family crest, since it plays on Evenzio Pico's unusual first name with a motto that reads <em>Eventus Bonus</em>, literally \"a good result,\" also the name of the Roman god of success and fruitfullness. The extensive front matter of the book presents it as a gift from the author to his erstwhile employers, the people of Ancona. It is unclear whether Pico intended this book as the capstone to a successful career or as a bid for re-employment in Ancona. But in any case it displays considerable vanity in offering his collected works behind a title page with a personal device.

Like humble Cafaro, however, Priscianese proposed a radical restructuring of the grammar course (see above, sections 2.11 and 2.13). In 1540, he offered the first edition of his new grammar (written in Italian), with a mysterious, full-page emblem on the verso of the last page. In a draped niche, we see a jeweled monstrance decorated with fleurs-de-lis and, in the central field, two palm fronds encircled by a crown. Above them hovers a palm wreath tied with a ribbon that surrounds the letters F S D N. On the base of the monstrance is the motto <em>Omnia octo</em> (\"All in eight,\" a proverb from the Byzantine writer Michael Apostolios), while the single line of poetry at the bottom of the page reads \"Whatever of true love exists is received in me\" (<em>Quanto Ã¨ di vero Amore in me s'accoglie</em>). This is about as deliberately obscure as an emblem can get. Indeed, though beautiful, the image detracts from the advertised utilitarianism of the work by inserting it into a highly academic context.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full/7.00_Chapter_Seven/Case-X-674.714,-Della-lingua-romana,-t.p.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full/7.00_Chapter_Seven/Case-X-674.714,-Della-lingua-romana,-t.p.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">The author on the title page (click to enlarge - 767 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>The book was pretentious in several other ways too.

The dedication is to Francis I, King of France (to whom the emblem might refer, though it does not include any of his personal insignia); and the volume included full texts of privileges from Pope Paul III and Emperor Charles V. It made reference as well to additional <em>privilegii amplissimi</em> from the French king, the Venetian Senate, the governments of Florence and Ferrara, and \"other lords of Italy.\" The name of the printer appears only on the second-last page in tiny type.

It is interesting, therefore, that the subsequent editions of his grammar, all printed after the expiration of his initial privileges, do not include this emblem and omit the title page portrait as well. We do not know the exact date of Priscianese's death, but it seems that these later editions were done without his supervision. Or perhaps Priscianese simply yielded to the publishing conventions of the day that permitted printers and publishers to display their proud marks with emblematic messages of their own.</p>\n<p>Girolamo Cafaro probably knew and imitated the grammar of Priscianese. At Cortona in 1546, as we have seen, he could only manage to elaborate his title page with a roughly cut phoenix emblem by a local artist. A second edition, done at Rome in 1555, was also called <em>Phoenix</em>, and displayed a new cut of the mythical bird, in every way more elegant and expertly done. An enlarged edition of the grammar appeared at Venice in 1560 where Cafaro transformed it again. The title <em>Phoenix</em> is gone, in favor of a more straightforward <em>Hieronymi Caphari Grammatice</em>. And the title page bears a woodcut portrait of Cafaro that seems to be a direct imitation of the Priscianese portrait of 1540. Presumably, Cafaro or his patrons were subsidizing these early editions, for they violated conventions</p>\n<p>The cases of Priscianese and Cafaro were exceptions to firm, general rules. The fact that their personal interventions lapsed later demonstrates that there were clearly understood and rarely contravened conventions of title-page emblematics. Institutional publishers could intervene for good reason to displace the printer's emblem. Authors too could stretch the rules in cases where they were subsidizing the production of the books themselves; but they could not make anomalous usages last long in the competitive marketplace. Textbooks were a particularly traditionalizing form; and these two authors distorted the norm in the service of their radical educational ideals as well as for self-promotion. But in the larger textbook market, where learning was for sale, it was the publishers who made decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(32)Â  Parenti 1973, 241; Grendler 1989, 192.

We know that educated people in the late Middle Ages could read publicly displayed images in highly sophisticated ways. (37)</p>\n<p>Still, the fully developed emblem was an invention of the age of printing and we can assume that its regular and widespread use in classrooms cannot have predated the production of printed emblem books. Alciati's pioneering emblem book appeared in print in 1531 and was reprinted frequently from the start. Within twenty years it had been published throughout Europe and translated several times. But none of the early Latin editions of Alciati can be said with certainty to have been intended for classroom use, and I have never seen a copy with notes by students or teachers. (38) By comparison to textbooks we have examined in earlier chapters, moreover, emblem books were relatively expensive and probably out of reach of many students.</p>\n<p>It is Alciati's translators who provide us with the earliest evidence that emblem books were put to classroom use. (39) The earliest translators were humanist teachers. Both Wolfgang Hunger (1511-1555), the law professor who made the first translation into German, and BarthÃ©lemy Aneau (d. 1561), a rhetorician who published a French translation in 1549, had studied in Bourges, where Alciati spent a large part of his early career. It is not certain that either of them ever met the great Italian jurist, but both trained with disciples of Alciati and both acquired an intense admiration for the classroom potential of the emblem book form. In the preface to his 1542 German translation, Hunger repeatedly stressed that his purpose is didactic, not recreational or belletristic. He hoped that \"students and teachers will find this golden little book attractive and commendable\" and that through studying it \"they will be able to dist</p>\n<p>Hunger's preface is unusually lengthy and fulsome. He listed almost all the themes future emblem book authors, editors, and translators would sound in describing the educational value of emblems. Hunger named the audience he had in mind as the \"sons of noblemen, the children of other wealthy persons, and youth more generally.\" Such a claim reproduced the social hierarchy of the period, and it did so in a way that advertised the book to a very broad public. Any youth could benefit, but the noble born, presumably future leaders, needed this kind of education most. Others, if they were ambitious, might imitate their betters. This kind of socially layered audience was implicit in almost all emblem books. Even those authors who named a narrower target readership than Hunger assumed that the larger society was hierarchical and that their particular readers would use the emblems to find and keep their proper social place. (41)</p>\n<p>Hunger situated his interest in Alciati in the context of his own humanist education to languages. Translating these emblems into French or German not only made them more accessible, it also enriched the general store of morally useful poetry. He specifically compared the utility of emblems to fables and proverbs and suggested that, like music, they would make studying easier and more pleasant for children. (42) These humanist commonplaces signified that, whatever other pretensions emblems had, they were also specifically applicable in the humanist classroom at a relatively elementary stage.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(37)Â  Carruthers 1990, 221-228.</li>\n<li>(38)Â  KÃ¶hler 1986, 109 note 4 mentions two copies now at WolfenbÃ¼ttel of the Augsburg 1531 first edition that show signs of school use, but he does not describe them.</li>\n<li>(39)Â  What follow depends heavily on the important work of Johannes KÃ¶hler 1986, esp. 56-64.</li>\n<li>(40)Â  Alciati 1542, 10-11: <em>pueris quoque nostratibus, &#x26; paedagogis, aureus hic libelllus futurus sut carhior forte, &#x26; comendiatior... virtutum splendorem &#x26; vitiorum foeditatem non aliter quam in tabella perspiciant</em>.

Emblems would become one of the emerging genres of children's literature, but the emblem book was never just a primer. Emblems were intended to be reused and reinterpreted in later moments of moral and literary reflection. Then too, emblem books were handsome, artistic products sold at substantial prices. They might well be used with young people but they were not trivial or throw-away books. We have seen this sort of expectation before, that textbooks would not only serve students through their school years but also accompany them for lifelong learning. As the sixteenth century progressed, this way of portraying emblems became more urgent and insistent. It may be that schoolmasters felt that, as the study of grammar and rhetoric became more instrumentalized (emphasizing techniques of composition in place of the earlier humanist ideal of internalizing wisdom through language study), it was all the more necessary to have other texts to hand that could be used for moral education. Print could provide profusely illustrated texts perfectly attuned to this purpose. Whether the marketers of printed emblem books created or followed this perceived pedagogical need we cannot say for sure, but it is clear that in many cases publishers took the lead. It would seem, for example, that Paris printer Christian Wechel first truly popularized Alciati's Latin collection; and it was Wechel who published the first French translation and who encouraged Wolfgang Hunger to complete his German version. (43)</p>\n<p>The work of BartolomÃ© Aneau as editor, translator, and arranger of the emblems of Alciati followed this same pattern. Aneau collaborated closely with several Lyon presses, especially that of MacÃ© Bonhomme (fl. 1536-1569) who had two specialties -- textbooks for teachers of Latin and courtesy books in French. Aneau crossed the boundaries between these two genres. He authored numerous works in French, including plays, fables, and proverbs translated from Greek and Latin. We know that some of his own original emblems were composed to fit woodcuts already in the shop of his printer. In order to make the emblem book more useful for moral education and more valuable for lifelong reference, Aneau developed a \"new\" Alciati, translated into French but also rearranged. Aneau put 201 emblems drawn from Alciati's earlier collections into a single sequence that presented ethical ideals systematically under a series of topics. The resulting collection was useful pedagogically in two ways. On a day-to-day instructional basis, it allowed teachers to present students with puzzles related to everyday decision making. The emblems presented concrete, pictorial ways of working through everyday moral choices. More generally (and educationally speaking in a second, more mature moment), the exercise of reading emblems provided students with an ethical tool for solving more difficult moral dilemmas and making sense of the world at large. It gave them a mirror in which to contemplate an individual's life problems as part of a larger civilizational ideal.

Johannes KÃ¶hler has suggested that the extensive commentary on Alciati by Claude Mignault (1536-1606), first published in 1576, was largely intended to describe and circumscribe Alciati for classroom use. (45) The bulky work of Mignault, however, was almost surely not put into the hands of children. If KÃ¶hler is correct, it was a teacher's manual for using emblems with students. Many individual emblems embody humanist commonplaces about teaching children; and while some seem aimed at the teaching parenting skills, others were clearly addressed to the children themselves. For example, emblems that recommended reading as a fruitful pastime were probably not in the first instance aimed at bookish adults. (46)</p>\n<p>In the course of rewriting and popularizing learned emblems for schoolboys and other, even less Latin-literate audiences (in preaching for example), some authors also tried to limit the possible readings that could be given to the innately puzzle-like emblem. There were several strategies for accomplishing this narrowing of meaning in the service of social control. Some authors circumscribed each emblem with commentary that dictated one or another moral meaning rather than offering a variety of interpretations. Another strategy was to change or expand the verses to direct the reader toward one reading or away from another. Some scholars see these re-writers as favoring a passive approach to emblems. Certainly they tended to simplify the experience. But the emblem remained a complex form. Even in its most fixed and determined form, the combination of picture and texts invited imaginative responses.

The initiative for this expansion of the basic Jesuit curriculum seems to have come from the order's Dutch and German provinces late in the sixteenth century. It was adopted by the Collegio Romano and other Italian schools only somewhat later. There is no direct mention of emblems in official Jesuit educational documents before the <em>Ratio Studiorum</em> of 1599, nor are they envisioned by any of the highly detailed regulations for Jesuit colleges in Italy. Jesuit emblems in formal classroom use were an import into Italy. It should be remembered in this regard that Italians looked upon the whole of the Jesuit curriculum as a foreign importation from the very start, at the founding of the first Jesuit college at Messina in 1548. The Jesuits' highly regulated <em>modus Parisiensis</em> envisioned a total-immersion style of Latin study for the younger students combined with rigorous religious training. Jesuit teachers successfully confronted substantial local opposition to these methods and rarely compromised with local authorities on educational matters. Throughout the sixteenth and well into the seventeenth century, they continued to devise and impose new methods of instruction. When emblematics became part of the curriculum in the North, it was also imported to Italy. (48)</p>\n<p>The Jesuits employed emblems for a variety of literary and pastoral purposes, and the majority of Jesuit emblem books did not see use in elementary or intermediate courses. But advanced students in the Jesuit colleges were expected to know how to use emblems. For example, when Juan de Pineda. S.J. (1512?-1593) prefixed a series of emblems on a sort of title page to his 1591 commentaries on the book of Job, he clearly assumed that his audience was educated to their proper use. The twelve emblems, one for each chapter of the commentary, had mnemonic value. They also invited the reader to use the commentary as a jumping off point for private meditation. Similarly, the Jesuits used emblems in works of systematic theology, in prayer books, and in preaching manuals that would not have appeared in classrooms of the colleges. Some Jesuit emblems seem to have been designed for the private use of aristocratic laymen as part of the work of spiritual direction that members of the order undertook at Catholic courts across Europe. Again, the Jesuits assumed their former students knew how to use emblems, so we can be sure some formal instruction occurred in the colleges. (49)</p>\n<p>Some kinds of Jesuit emblems were very close to curriculum concerns, especially in the context of the residential colleges where members of the Society closely supervised the spiritual life of their charges. Teachers in the colleges, as we have remarked elsewhere, taught Latin grammar as a skill without burdening it overmuch with moral import. But the students learned more than Latin. They also conformed to a rigorous program of religious exercises: daily mass and examination of conscience at an early age, frequent confession and communion, and exercises in meditative prayer. Some Jesuit emblem books follow this spiritual program closely. Almost all of them employ highly emotional language and vivid imagery in keeping with the meditative principles enunciated by Ignatius Loyola.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full//7.00_Chapter_Seven/HFS_014.04.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full//7.00_Chapter_Seven/HFS_014.04.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">Nadal's version of a parable (click to enlarge - 471 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>Scholars have noted that Ignatius seems to have collected religious images for his own devotional use. Jesuit emblem books were comparable collections crystallized in print and intended to be put to use by all who subscribed to the Jesuit religious program. Ignatius commissioned GerÃ³nimo Nadal (1507-1580), the founder of the college at Messina, to compose a gospel paraphrase with illustrations, the Pictures of Gospel History (<em>Evangelicae Historiae Imagines</em>). Some consider this the first Jesuit emblem book. Though not true emblems (since they do not have mottoes), these pictures were used in classrooms; and they functioned very much like emblems by inviting students to visualize the incidents described in the accompanying texts. Nadal's book embodied the early Jesuits' belief that pictures were aids to teaching Christian truths, a principle they would go on to incorporate in works as varied as advanced theology texts and illustrated catechisms for the barely literate. (50)</p>\n<p>The direct use of true emblems in Jesuit classrooms in Italy is not attested until the <em>Ratio Studiorum</em> of 1599, where suddenly it appeared as an accepted part of the course of rhetoric. Emblem-making was one of composition exercises given to relatively advanced students. Presumably the Jesuits had been experimenting with emblems for some years before they came into use at the Collegio Romano, where the final version of the <em>Ratio</em> was drafted. In the context of formal rhetoric, the emblem was no longer merely a piece of religious art used in the classroom, it was also a functional rhetorical device. It did not just prompt multiple readings or encourage meditation. It also invited rhetorical <em>inventio</em>, the active creation of new literary expression.

The Collegio Romano library owned two early Latin editions, neither of them published in Italy.

These angels appeared alongside adults or children who represented the souls of the penitent. For example, Hugo and his engraver-collaborator BoÃ«ce van Bolswert (ca. 1580-1633) illustrated the Psalm-verse \"Lord thou knowest my foolishness\" with a cherubic guardian angel who covers his eyes rather than behold the antics of a fool. (53) The fool is depicted in more adult form than the angel, but they are about the same height, so their ages remain ambiguous. More important to understanding the dynamic of the child-angel is the fact that the angel is not mentioned in the motto or the poem and really plays no functional role in the theme of this emblem. The cherub here merely stands in for the reader as viewer of the emblematic action. In some cases both the guardian angel and the soul are children.

Very occasionally, the childlike figures were preserved, as for example when both Dutch and Italian editions portrayed a childlike penitent before a bench at which a cherubic judge presides. (55) Sometimes the figures have merely aged a few years at Milan. The emblem for Job10,20, \"Shall not the fewness of my days be ended shortly?\" displayed a pair of very young children in 1624 and a pair of older ones in 1634. (56) More often however, the artist for the Milanese edition (probably Carlo Bianchi, fl. 1610-1635) made the protagonists over completely into adolescents or adults. The angel and the fool, for example, are both adults in the Milan version of Emblem I,5. In the very next emblem a child angel consoles a sick adult in 1624, but the angel in 1634 is clearly adolescent and not childlike. (57) Hermann Hugo and BoÃ«ce van Bolswaert apparently thought that introducing child actors and childlike observers was important to the thematic development of the book or to its potential audience. But Bianchi either did not understand this aim or had a different audience in mind. The 1634 Milan edition is dedicated to an aristocratic nun, so the publisher may have been thinking of convent readers rather than children.

But the Antwerp Jesuits had a further goal, I think, to include even their youngest charges into a community of learning where emblematic thinking became second nature. The artists and authors wanted children in the pictures specifically so readers would draw the conclusion that such morals were <em>not</em> for grownups only. Clearly, then, they had an audience in mind that included both real children and also older students who could still identify with children. (60)</p>\n<p>Historians have tended to treat the so-called college emblem books in a separate category from other Jesuit emblems. These emblem collections were created and published by single Jesuit colleges. It is difficult to identify a specific audience for them, but they were not mere curiosities, since some titles ran to several editions. Books like these came out of the rhetoric curriculum. They offered completed exercises by advanced students (closely supervised by their instructors, of course). It is not clear that they were intended to be taken back into the classroom in a second moment.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<figure class=\"mkdn-figure\">\r\n    <div onClick=\"createLightbox('/images_full//7.00_Chapter_Seven/HFS_010.05.jpg')\" data=\"/images_full/0.00_Introduction/Wing-ZP-535.D175Negrotitle.jpg\" class=\"mkdn-image-link\" id=\"lbimage\">\r\n    <img class=\"mkdn-image\" src=\"/images_full//7.00_Chapter_Seven/HFS_010.05.jpg\" />\r\n    <figcaption class=\"mkdn-figcaption\">&quot;We play around&quot; (click to enlarge - 888 KB jpeg image)</figcaption>\r\n    </div>\r\n</figure>\n<p>The students do seem to have bought into the notion of the emblem as an entertaining way of learning. Thus, the best known college book, the <em>Typus Mundi</em>, is exceedingly playful; the students made fun of themselves and even of their teachers. As their preface to the reader says, \"œWe are youths, we are rhetoricians. Just when you expect a great deal of us, we play around.\" (61)</p>\n<p>Inventing emblems was part of the rhetoric curriculum in Italy too, but few Jesuit colleges there produced emblems in print. The single, notable exception is the 1603 <em>Imprese di Tre Academie Partenie</em>, dedicated by its publisher Giovanni Battista Piccaglia to Cesare Speziano, reform-minded bishop of Cremona. This 106-page volume contains only three emblems, one for each of the Jesuit-sponsored Parthenic academies, supposedly extra-curricular confraternities of the Blessed Virgin restricted to small groups of noble students at the three largest Jesuit colleges in Rome, Naples, and Milan. Unlike Jesuit students from the Netherlands or France, these young noblemen did not offer true emblems. Instead, they followed the Italian fashion of inventing imprese, that is, truncated emblems with picture and motto but no explanatory poem. Instead, they provided lengthy prose explications attributed to the student presidents of each academy. It is clear that each academy's <em>impresa</em> was a group project of the advanced rhetoric students. They scoured ancient and medieval literature (and modern encyclopedic works) for learned quotations to embellish their understanding of the symbols chosen. The authors praised, among other things, cooperation among themselves both in spiritual life and in the pursuit of eloquence, chastity and devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary, and real mastery of ancient literature. (62) They also made the point that the emblem of a student collective must be useful to all its members even those of only middling intelligence. (63) There is no doubt that the three emblem essays were separately composed, since the style and tone of each is distinct, but these are students who have learned their lessons well and have thoroughly internalized the Jesuit world view.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(53)Â  Emblem I,5; Ps 68, 6: <em>Deus tu scis insipientiam meam</em>.</li>\n<li>(54)Â  Manning 2002, 179 adduces \"local visual convention\" for these child figures and claims that Hugo could not have intended his complex baroque poetry for children.

Indeed the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw a trend in Italian emblem-making that was exactly the opposite of the popularizations common in Northern Europe. Among Italian emblematists, theory took center stage with the appearance of a number of weighty methodological works. Italian theorists concentrated on the abbreviated emblem-form called <em>impresa</em>. The <em>impresa</em> was typically conceived as a personal device rather than a commonplace one, so it related a particular, sometimes hidden truth about an individual or a closed group. The authors did not necessarily propose useful themes for others to imitate. Italians, moreover, consistently emphasized esoteric and elitist emblem-making. <em>Imprese</em> were meant for members of the elites, especially for the gentlemen and scholars who belonged to the Italian academies. The emblems of academies defined the group against others. In this rarified atmosphere emblematics participated in a revival of Neo-Platonic thought and played an important part in the debates over the nature of poetry. The academic <em>impresa</em> was above all a vehicle of meditative poetics and a machine for contemplation of the divine. It was a stimulus to the quest for personal and corporate virtue. (64)</p>\n<p>We do know of a few specific instances of educational, even classroom use of emblems in Italy. What we know of them, however, reinforces our sense that they were exceptional and suggests as well the ways in which the Italian emblem \"scene\" was distinct from that of Northern Europe. Above all, Italian educational emblems almost always trained students in devising or resolving the esoteric dimensions of the emblem or <em>impresa</em>, not in the potential pastoral or popularizing functions of the form that were most important in emblem making elsewhere. Even the Jesuit emblems of the <em>Imprese di tre Academie</em> follow the Italian tradition and not that of northern emblem making. Though the emblems all relate to a specific Christian doctrine, the chastity of the Virgin Mary, they do so for the sake of creating collegiality among an elite group of students. The lengthy explications are weighted down with citations from classical and Christian literature. And the student authors explicitly measured their <em>imprese</em> against the standards for the genre described in the most prestigious Italian manual of emblem making, Scipione Bargagli's <em>Delle Imprese</em>, which had seen print in successively larger editions between 1578 and 1594. (65)</p>\n<p>Outside the Jesuit colleges, Italian teachers seem to have used emblems only occasionally if at all. The humanist schools of the fifteenth century included intensive study of Christian symbols. Students also studied and composed ecphrastic poetry that evoked the works of Christian art displayed in churches and other public places. This older tradition of literary image-making and image-reading was an essential part of the humanist rhetoric curriculum. It was replaced in Italian schools only rarely by the study or creation of true emblems, and then only late in the sixteenth century as far as we can tell. By sharp contrast to French, German, and Dutch schools, where an abundance of evidence points to frequent emblem-making, there are only a few documentable examples of emblems in use in Italian schools. The Milanese educationist Giulio Porri,</p>\n<p>By the middle of the seventeenth century, preaching, iconographic programs, and religious publishing had made the emblem ubiquitous in Italy, even for parts of the public relatively unschooled in Latin. The Counter-Reformation may be credited with this flourishing of the public emblem. Preaching and meditative manuals, art works commissioned for the churches of every religious order and even for parish churches, posters and shop signs --all these forms could function emblematically. Most did so on several levels at once, from esoteric to streetwise. Thus, a single emblem (like the poster of the Wounds of Christ examined above) could serve as the basis for elaborate, private meditative practice, as the pompous, communitarian symbol of a confraternity, and also as a call to prayer aimed at the whole populace of Rome, native and pilgrim alike.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(64)Â  Bregoli Russo 1990, 225-240; Ciardi 1995, 38-45; Maggi 1997, 17-23; Maggi 1998b, 368-369; Maggi 2000a, 116-121 and 2000b, 212-215; Manning 2002, 73-79.</li>\n<li>(65)Â  <em>Imprese</em> 1603, 2-6, 36-40; Maggi 1998b, 370-371.</li>\n<li>(66)Â  Turchini 1996, 317.</li>\n</ul>","excerpt":"Except in Jesuit schools, we have little solid evidence that Italians used emblems in classrooms.

In Latin classrooms this apparently was the case, but it was only partly true in the more generalized pastoral realm. North of the Alps, it would seem that ordinary layfolk owned emblem books more often than was the case in Italy. The extensive collections of non-scholarly emblems common in the North were rarely printed in Italy. But preachers used emblems in both Catholic and Protestant countries and there is little apparent difference between North and South in the display of individual emblems. If anything, they were more elaborately and exuberantly displayed in Italian and other Catholic churches than in the Protestant North, where they seem to have appeared in public more in triumphal or processional contexts than in permanent church art.</p>\n<p>Both North-South and Catholic-Protestant differences disappear entirely if we turn to the other major practical application we discussed in section 7.05, the emblematic printer's mark. Unlike educational emblems, emblematic printer's marks were regularly and consistently used in Italy. In part this simply reflects the continuing traditionalism and particularism of Italian educational practice. Increasingly cut off from the Protestant North, Italy's schools failed to respond to humanist educational reforms that were too closely linked in the minds of Italian churchmen to Reformation spirituality. Meanwhile, the progress of the Catholic Reform led educators in Italy in different practical directions -- even, as we saw in the case of Terence (section 1.19), attempts to limit the teaching of highly traditional school authors.</p>\n<p>Even more than highlighting the traditionalism of the schools, however, the varying European experiences of using emblems point up that the emblematic printer's mark somehow escaped the kind of circumscribing religious and political censorship that affected other sorts of emblematics. The printer's mark preceded the literary emblem as a form and was an established part of printing practice and intellectual life before the start of the Reformation. It would survive and flourish long after emblem books became mere curiosities. It held its prominent place on Catholic and Protestant books alike and disappeared from view only rarely, when the printer needed to be invisible because the book might be considered heterodox or subversive. We may well ask what mysterious force the printer's mark owned. The textbook market, as durable and multiform as the marks themselves, offers us an easy test case for the meaning and power of the emblematic printer's mark. (67)</p>\n<p>Although the form was no more than fifty years older than the emblem, the printer's mark was part of a publishers' <em>lingua franca</em> throughout Europe. It had quickly arrived in Africa, the Far East, and the New World on the title pages of books carried by traders, missionaries, and <em>conquistadores</em>. Religious and missionary works were among these books because the spread of Christianity was a primary goal of official European travelers; but the need to educate new Christians to European languages and political norms was equally urgent. Teachers in the outposts of empire would provide a ready market for textbooks. It is no surprise, then, that carefully branded editions of Cicero and Terence, De Spauter, Perotti or Alvarez, Alciati or Hugo were read in Lima and Boston, in Quebec and Manila and Cape Town and Goa. In those outposts of European imperialism, printer's marks endorsed the quality of editions that bore them and bespoke the <em>bona fides</em> of their publishers.</p>\n<p>Thus, we must posit a distinct school of emblematic thought that embraces the printer's mark, sets it off from other kinds of emblems, and accounts for its survival well past the greatest vogue of emblem books proper. Whatever other force and meaning it had, the emblematic printer's mark was a commercial object, the ancestor of modern, pictorially allusive advertising. (68) We have seen how it compared to emblems on early posters in this regard, since in both cases the emblem stood relatively alone, with a single-minded communicative goal, and without immediate reference to other printed objects. On a title page or in a colophon the emblem's primary function was as a label and guarantee in the market for books. It had no pretensions to be an educational tool or an ideological symbol in itself. Nor was it a moralizing literary genre. In some ways it retained the playfulness of the original emblems of Alciati. Beyond its role as a hallmark, it was mostly a puzzle and a mental exercise --no more, no less.</p>\n<p>Given these conventions of creation and use, the emblematic printer's mark was an important locus of mediation between book workers and book users. The mark symbolized both cultural unity in the European book market and also the pride of individual makers in their work. Even as Europe tore itself apart religiously and politically in the long sixteenth century, and while governments at every level sought to exploit and control the press, book workers claimed a universal brotherhood and the right to communicate directly with each other and with their public. Students learned a common way of reading images from the marks on the title pages of their textbooks. A quick way for a teacher to find or locate the right textbook in a crowded shop was to spot the Jesuit monogram or the mark of a trusted publisher -- the Aldine anchor, the Giunta lily, or the griffin of Giovanni Griffio -- according to his preference for this or that brand in a particular unit of the curriculum. Government and church authorities too kept an eye out for the marks of suspect printers and even more for heterodox books that did not guarantee their truth with a proper printer's mark. In anticipation of a much more modern mindset, emblems on books allowed Europeans to act locally even as they more and more often thought globally.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(67)Â  Cf.

Humanists sold an educational program to parents and a philological one to the scholarly world. They sold their services as thinkers, writers, and public speakers to patrons both public and private. Of course, intellectuals had done these things for centuries, on a small scale at least; but the humanists of the long sixteenth-century had another, much larger opportunity for public relations created by the new market for print. They used print to discuss their ideas with each other and to elaborate their program for a more general public. They sold their services to the printers; and they helped printers sell books to the public. In the cases most extensively discussed in <em>Humanism For Sale</em> they authored textbooks on commission for publishers, or organized editorial work for a publishing enterprise, or acted as publishers themselves. Some few even printed and sold their own books.</p>\n<p>Beyond the textbook market, and even sometimes within it, humanists were buyers too. A large portion of the literary discourse of the sixteenth century appeared in books and pamphlets that were subsidized by their authors so thoroughly that they were in fact simply buying publishing services from a local press. For some publishers and in some cities, this kind of vanity publishing was the norm, representing the largest single part of their finances. (1) In such cases it is not strictly correct to speak of a marketplace, except insofar as the subsidies created products that then went onto the market without substantial risk to the printer. By contrast, most textbooks were published for a truly competitive, even cutthroat market. The rare exceptions -- largely Latin grammars for a single schools subsidized by teachers who either did not approve of older, standard texts or wanted to make a career with something under their own name -- can be spotted easily. They had no imitators and no afterlife. (2)</p>\n<p>In a much larger sense, however, humanists sold ideas retail, piece by piece, because a hallmark of humanist thought was the creation and adaptive re-use of commonplaces. Commonplaces took many commercial forms. Oratory had always been a well-rewarded art, and sermons in particular were confected out of commonplaces from ancient times forward. In the later Middle Ages they were collected and sold in manuscript form; and sermon collections would become a staple of the new print culture precisely because they sold well.

Every kind of humanist literature proceeded by commonplace, and so every humanist-inspired book retailed commonplace thoughts. Some genres were more thoroughly commonplace than others, and textbooks were prominent among them because they were by their nature introductory treatments, composed in small, well-labeled sections designed to be easily digestible by young or inexperienced readers. Textbooks in turn helped create habits of mind that informed all humanist writing. Even Erasmus' <em>Adagia</em> or Alciati's <em>Emblemata</em>, the grandest of all commonplace books, partook of this digestive, ruminative character.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n<li>(1) See the important recent study of the Florentine publisher Marescotti by Bertoli 2007, esp. 87-92.</li>\n<li>(2) One exception, discussed in section 7.10, was Girolamo Cafaro.

Perhaps the truest advertising was that of Francesco Priscianese, who advocated the thoroughgoing use of vernacular in the classroom. Other radicals were abbreviators who cut the course content to a minimum needed for reading comprehension and jettisoned the ideal of a fully realized classical Latinity. Still other reformers expunged pagan sample texts altogether or used Cicero to critique the established Roman church. None of these late-century reformers succeeded in supplanting the traditional early humanist pedagogy or the reformed one of the Despauterians which had meanwhile become well entrenched. It would take the universalizing mission and influence of the Jesuits to effect a more thoroughgoing reform.</p>\n<p>Seen in this broad context, Manuel Alvares, S.J. must be considered one of the radical reformers. His reform of the Latin course was fully classicizing, Romanizing, and motivated by the larger Jesuit program of studies. He was radical in that he truly realized the antiquarian aims of earlier humanists. He propounded pure Latinity, rejection of all post-classical forms, a rigorous system of rules and exceptions, even abandoning mnemonic verses. In this last innovation his fellow Jesuits deserted him; they restored the mnemonic verses almost as soon as Alvares was in his grave. But his grammar achieved another radical goal that had not been part of the humanist program, divorcing Latin from Christian literature and from the long-held idea that Latin grammar was a moral art in itself. The Jesuits had their own, more philosophical approach to morals and they were willing to make Latin over into a tool without intrinsic moral power.</p>\n<p>In this regard, the Jesuits were thoroughly modern and forward-looking, for most language textbooks of the future would do the same. Slowly across the long sixteenth century a new market emerged for teaching and learning tools in vernacular languages. We have seen that at first these books too emphasized morality as the proper context of learning. Indeed they did so stridently and defensively, probably because their authors feared that they were putting powerful intellectual tools once an elite monopoly into the hands of relatively unschooled commoners. But the expanding vernacular market slowly demanded more instrumental textbooks -- simplified, skills-oriented, unburdened with philosophical or moral goals. Early modern textbooks never achieved anything like the twentieth-century ideal of value-free content, but they did move gradually in the direction of skills-based education. Moreover, whether Latin or vernacular, a textbook with no pretensions to higher values was a mere commodity. It was easier to buy and sell and more broadly palatable in a Europe increasingly riven by nationalistic and religious rivalries.</p>","excerpt":"Around mid-century the claims to innovation became more insistent and the reforms more substantial.

The long sixteenth century (and the age of print) began amidst the full flowering of humanist rhetoric, whose practitioners followed Cicero in claiming that their discipline's greatest power was the ability to persuade. Much of pre-print humanism viewed the goal of such persuasion personally, as the moral improvement of the individual. Rhetoric of this sort, in the form of private study, tutoring, and small schools, conduced to a life well lived (that is, to a commonplace, morally conformist life) and to personal salvation in the afterlife. Humanists and other writers also assumed a communitarian ideal, in which the ability to persuade others in large groups led to the betterment of society as a whole. The myth of the origin of rhetoric that stands at the beginning of Cicero's <em>De inventione</em> was the commonplace most often cited for this rhetorical philosophy. Cicero's original sage was the orator who first persuaded his fellows to organize themselves politically and economically. (3)</p>\n<p>These non-commercial ideals of persuasive rhetoric did not fail or even weaken when they entered the print market. On the contrary, they found a new and wider audience. Across the late Middle Ages and the early modern period, they increasingly displaced less rhetorical models of Christianity. (4) They remained the highest ideals of European civilization for centuries. In one way or another they are still with us.</p>\n<p>Printing, however, slowly became the primary rhetorical medium, and the new medium imposed new norms. Philology, not just morality, became both a selling point and a goal in life. The case of Terence shows how productive the new print reality could be but also how constraining the classroom context was. In the first forty years of printing Terence, the market was almost exclusively for teaching editions that contained poorly edited texts. The value added by printers was largely in the form of old and new commentaries. These editions looked solemnly the same and were in fact largely unoriginal. But the philological work embodied in the many competing commentaries slowly built momentum for a</p>\n<p>The sixteenth century also saw many new packages for teaching Terence. These classroom formats determined competitiveness in the market. The text of Terence was so intimately connected with Latin-language learning that it never quite had a literary life of its own. The great moments of philological progress on the text (Poliziano's notes, Aldo's edition, and later Faerno's) caused a certain amount of scholarly excitement, it is true; but philological advances were quickly absorbed by the textbook market and the competition reverted to being one between publishers who touted new classroom formats or teacher-editors of note. However beloved and imitated, Terence remained a school author.</p>\n<p>The market for elementary Latin grammars displayed many of the same characteristics as that for intermediate school authors like Terence. Originality was rarely an issue, and what novelties there were usually concerned bringing old rules and proof-texts up to date by reference to ongoing philological research on the classics. Grammar textbooks were particularly unstable because they were almost never more than exercise pieces. Every teacher at every period felt free to modify them for his own classroom. Marketing for such textbooks relied heavily on the reputations of modern authors and editors. Guarino, Perotti, Mancinelli, De Spauter, Priscianese, and Bonciari each in turn became a brand name for a kind of textbook or a kind of pedagogy.</p>\n<p>The rhetoric of selling textbooks changed relatively little before the mid-sixteenth century. Latin was marketed in print just as it had been by the earliest humanists, in threefold fashion: as a career-enhancing professional language, as the key to the treasures of ancient wisdom, and as a morally improving discipline. Different authors emphasized one or another of these themes, but they all appeared repeatedly. Authors and editors in the early sixteenth century did devise and sell new packages for the Latin course. Some emphasized the novelty of the textbooks themselves -- better type or design -- but most also claimed, like De Spauter and his followers, to be offering a more effective Latin pedagogy. Mostly these claims meant more and better-defined drills and, on the level of book design, clearer and better paradigms and other diagrammatic aids to memorization.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hfsgatsby/bibliography.pdf\">Open Bibliography</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>3 Elkins 1999, 209-212.\r\n4 Rummel 1995, 3-7, 193-195.</p>","excerpt":"Sales pitches were never far to seek in humanist books, and though the commonplaces employed were always high-sounding and usually derived from classical sources, the flood of competing books in the print market lent urgency to both packaging and…","frontmatter":{"id":null,"slug":"/text/802","title":"8.02 The Rhetoric of Print","post_id":null,"author":null,"date":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<!-- reserved page for Comments By Section -->","excerpt":"","frontmatter":{"id":null,"slug":"/text/4","title":"Comments By Section","post_id":null,"author":null,"date":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Most of <em>Humanism For Sale</em> says very little about prices or profits. Some documents exist for studies of book prices in local markets, but they are complicated by a variety of uncertainties. Inflation rates, the effects of political events on currency values, and the persistent use of credit and discounting in book sales at every stage in distribution all mean that the many numbers we can find in local archives cannot be aggregated or compared with those in other sources or other cities. The rare studies available on large, international publishing houses demonstrate that textbooks and other minor genres played an important role in the overall profitability of these firms. Individual genres or single titles, however, cannot be evaluated clearly in terms of their contribution to the bottom line.</p>\n<p>Profits to authors are an even trickier subject of study. Authors who failed to profit or who felt they did not do so sufficiently complained loudly enough. (We saw the examples of Antonio Mancinelli and Jean Pellisson in sections 3.01 and 3.02.) But those who profited adequately did not record the fact directly. In any case, rewards in the educational market were widely and unevenly distributed. An author might be paid in several ways. He might get a commission, fee, or honorarium; he might receive a portion of the print run in return for his services; or he might take his profits less tangibly in the prestige of a publication or in the convenience of having his textbooks readily available for use in his own school. He might profit in all these ways at once. We have good evidence for all these forms, but there are not enough figures to allow for quantification or comparison, much less meaningful generalization. There is no way to know if a given contract or payment was frugal or generous, standard or exceptional. The cases for which we have the greatest amount of detail -- Bonciari in Perugia, for example, or Mancinelli at Velletri and Rome -- suggest that local traditions of study, provincial reputations, personal networks of patronage, and small-town civic pride were the most important factors in how well a given teacher was paid and how well his brand of humanism sold on the print market. His textbook sales are never mentioned.</p>\n<p>In larger, less provincial cities, textbook authors did not usually profit directly from repeat sales. Once a given textbook had proven itself in the market, it was up to the publisher to decide whether it merited the added investment of a second or further editions. The \"Despauterian\" case is particularly telling in this way. De Spauter himself tinkered with his textbooks throughout his later life. He may have profited from the new editions, but there is no direct evidence for it except that his publishers continued to encourage and advertise his revisions. Similarly, Jean Pellisson apparently did not profit from or even authorize any of the early reprints of his own elementary textbook; but he did re-assert control of it when he revised it for a later edition. In a second stage of his publishing career, Pellisson edited and abridged De Spauter for the French market. Presumably he was paid for that work, but again the texts he devised got away from him and were widely reprinted throughout France during his lifetime and after. Still later, Pellisson's \"Despauterian\" textbooks were imported into the Italian market, and it was up to the Italian publishers to decide whether they were marketed primarily as Pellisson's work or De Spauter's. Neither author profited at this point. Theirs had become brand names for a pedagogical style, used by many publishers who sold textbooks marketed under the emblematic logos of their own presses. Similarly, Andrea Alciati probably never profited directly from his popular emblem collection. After a period of attempting to correct and add to it, he abandoned it to the realm of pure celebrity.</p>\n<p>Humanism was for sale, then, in many ways, but it did not have a single market or price structure. Textbooks offer some of the most concrete evidence we have for the economic dimensions of humanism, but even they can only tell us part of the story. They offer hints as to the needs of students and the desires of parents. They tell us a great deal about the role of printers and publishers in creating a market for learning. Textbooks also tell us about the internal logic of the school disciplines, both traditional and new ones. Many textbooks offer windows on the classrooms of local schools with local traditions of pedagogy and printing. Most vividly, however, textbooks represent the highly self conscious, highly rhetorical presupposition of their authors that learning was a goal in several ways: for professional advancement or other practical reasons, for moral improvement, and as an end in itself.</p>","excerpt":"Most of Humanism For Sale says very little about prices or profits.

The authors suggested that it should be possible for the neophyte to master the scripts they describe without a professional teacher. At the same time, however, they were setting out to embellish their own reputations as professional teachers of scripts and inventors of new teaching methods. Armando Petrucci notes that these intersecting claims are not fully compatible. As a first step, the new writing masters distinguished themselves from humble teachers who merely transformed illiterates into literates. Textbook authors also promised to turn the newly literate into professional scribes qualified to serve in bureaucracies of the pen -- the government offices of emerging modern states. Printing was an essential tool for the ambitions of these writing masters. They could improve their own social status only by publishing writing manuals that at once disseminated their pedagogical principles and enlarged their claims to cultural influence and prestige. (50)</p>\n<p>Pedagogically, the writing masters were attempting to do two quite different things. First, they offered an entirely new kind of elementary instruction through textbooks that summarized skills hitherto taught only through practice. Their greatest originality was at this most elementary level of instruction. At a second level, however, they attempted to provide professional training for the purpose of full-time clerical employment. The language of the manuals reflects this dual purpose. The authors employed a lively, popular, bourgeois Italian with many regional and dialect forms. Their books embody the vernaculars spoken in elementary classrooms. On the other hand they taught chancery hand, the unified script of cultured Italians throughout the peninsula. Petrucci believes that the writing masters of the first half of the sixteenth century failed in their social ambitions because the skills they offered were still traditional ones and the working life of the scribes they trained was so routine that it did not allow for genuine artistic achievement. Only later in the century, when writing masters also ventured into the field of epigraphic and architectural lettering did they succeed in transforming themselves into graphic designers in the service of powerful political figures. (51)</p>\n<p>The advertising of handwriting manuals developed in this same direction across the century. Tagliente in 1524 wrote as a servant of the Venetian state, proud of his career as the official teacher of government scribes; but rhetorically he stayed close to his own middling social class. Without embarrassment he compared the well-equipped scribe to a \"barber [who] can never shave a beard well without hurting the man who is being shaved, unless he has a razor honed to a cutting edge.\" (52) A year or so later, Ludovico Arrighi aimed a little higher for models, taking his cue perhaps from the papal court where he worked and where his colleagues included a number of internationally renowned musicians: \"Just as a man who wishes to learn to play a musical instrument must also know how to tune it, because many contingencies may occur, so for many reasons the student who aims to learn handwriting must know how to cut quills.\" (53) Starting in 1540 with the <em>Libro nuovo d'imparare a scrivere</em> of Giovanbattista Palatino (d. ca. 1565?), writing masters openly criticized each other, patently attempting to aggrandize their own reputations at the expense of others. This same generation (including, besides Palatino, Giovanni Francesco Cresci and Luca Orfeo da Fano) began to claim that public lettering was a powerful political tool, and that the writing master was not just a scribe, but also, at least potentially, a propagandist</p>\n<p>Calligraphic manuals in print played a major part in creating the personal reputations of all the leading designers of these later generations. Their epigraphic commissions were rarely signed, so they had to look to other forums in which to put their name before the public permanently. Like earlier writing masters they used print to validate reputations they had already achieved through teaching and patronage. On the level of book design, the generation of aggrandizers made an important innovation by turning the axis of the textbook page and presenting their writing specimens in landscape format, the better to make even chancery hand look as if it were inscribed on tablets of stone. They refashioned textbook authorship too. The author was now an artist; he made not a simple handwriting textbook but rather a calligraphic album that was an art object in its own right. As such, most of the important later calligraphic manuals were more specimen books than textbooks, well beyond the scope of our study. Real, skills-oriented handwriting manuals continued to be produced right up to the twentieth century, but often in very humble formats. Even the showiest of calligraphic specimen books, moreover, sometimes still included how-to sections in recognition of two facts: that even talented scribes continued to make a living as teachers, and that some in the public for such books were amateurs looking to educate themselves.
