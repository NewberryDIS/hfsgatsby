Creating an idea is a difficult task because the creator is using his/her own innate imagination to bring something new into existence. Now, this is the entire premise of the Renaissance, to create new ideas and new values for life with inspiration from the past, in the midst of technological inventions that aided in the transmission of the later. My mind then drifted to the concept of \"œreproduction\". In this context, \"œreproduction\" is unoriginal and, in a sense, unfortunate. It pulls the readers attention away from the beauty of the creation process and the authenticity of the authors own language, due to the many errors Mancinelli mentioned occurred as a result of mass printing. Why did you choose to use these words to describe printers? I ask this question because the printing press was a novelty that opened the doors for knowledge to be transmitted literally across cultures and across nations. I see this as an asset, not a draw back. This phrase is essentially putting the creator (humans) against machine (printing press). Remember the creator was the one who brought the machine into existence. I feel I am pushing the boarders to the philosophical level, which many humanists would be proud of. I cannot even begin to imagine our generation surviving without the basic necessity of print. There are pros and cons to the argument. Mancinelli praises the product of the printing press, that is the mass transmission of knowledge, but critics its frequent errors and the constant need to update the text. He enjoys the many benefits the printing press has allowed for in the realm of teaching and education, but discusses that it also \"œgave some fairly ordinary teachers in Mancinelli's generation (and ever since) the opportunity for a permanent, or at least long-term literary reputation specifically as textbook writers.\"</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"722b9b80-c756-5363-ae80-cff1eb7add2a"}},
