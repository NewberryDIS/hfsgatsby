Dennis Rhodes points out (<em>La Bibliofilia</em> 117 (2015), pp. 231-234) that at least two grammar books published there now survive in single copies. That one grammar by the internationally known Giovanni Battista Cantalicio (d. 1515) and another by the obscure Angelo Fino (dates unknown) survive in this way suggests that the city had a micro-market for single editions of such works, presumably created at mid 16th century for a local school. Cantalicio is in fact another example of a Perugian master (he taught grammar there ca. 1488) whose textbooks achieved international status because they were publsihed in Siena, Rome, Venice and elsewhere. The Perugian edition mentioned by Rhodes is the only one known to have been printed there, and it dates from some years after the author's death.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"36587abc-8b74-5e5d-a34a-dffa0458f1b7"}},
