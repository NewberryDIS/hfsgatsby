An important thing to remember, however, is that Montaigne was born thirty years after Mancinelli's death, and the first edition of his <em>Essays</em> came out only in 1580, fully a hundred years after Mancinelli's first publications. Montaigne represents a highly developed version of humanism, strongly secularizing and literary, and aimed at adult readers. Mancinelli was a teacher, devout and religiously conformist, with rather more limited goals for his readers, who were after all mostly students.</p>\n<p>There isn't much evidence that Mancinelli encouraged conversation of the reforming sort that Montaigne presented as an ideal. Mancinelli clearly thought he was teaching ethics along with grammar, but he was doing so --expressly-- by making his students master the content of salutary texts.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5e42dc34-cb1a-50a7-ae3e-a1228fd86cfc"}},
