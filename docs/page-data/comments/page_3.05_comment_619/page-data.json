Of course there are examples such as that of Martin Luther who used the written word to express discontent with the censorship of the established church, but were there any measures in place to ensure that what was printed was not used to deceive the masses? The advent of technology that rapidly diffuses information seems to me as a double edged sword, with those whose agenda includes actually spreading useful knowledge with others whose agenda includes falsification of major historical events, revisions to fit a prescribed world view, etc. It seems as though with the cost of owning or running a printing machine, only the elite had the opportunity to spread knowledge, possibly to the detriment of others. As always with technology there is this potential for benefit or hinderance, and I'm wondering what other downsides, if any, there were to the introduction of print? (other than printing errors) I'm mostly thinking along the lines of how rewriting information by hand and story telling are two very effective ways to memorize information rather than simply reading printed words on a page and memorizing, which may lead to pacification in smaller tutoring style settings</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"53d375b6-8b6a-50d8-84cb-cb68415a3a4c"}},
