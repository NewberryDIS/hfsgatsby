In fact there are at least three hands here, probably more. What shows up as a sort of smudge toward the top is probably the earliest mark, an ownership mark by a youth named Liberio. Most if not all the boxes contain an anagram poem, probably repeated by the same reader over and over. I would guess he is also responsible for the two roughly drawn penises, because the ink is very similar. The long, loose lines in greyish ink quoting a bit of doggerel in Italian, \"Chi vuol saver...\" are by yet another reader. And the marks in reddish brown ink --including a comic profile head-- are surely yet another young owner. The all-over effect is, therefore, the result of accumulation, not the work of a single scribbler.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c11134a0-9707-5018-b43e-c516eb485cb1"}},
