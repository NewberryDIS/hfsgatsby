Scrolling to the bottom of the page leads to \"Next: 0.02 Regionalism\" allowing for the sort of linear continuity Diana seems to be seeking. Perhaps this is slightly less intuitive since it appears after the footnotes (if one skips the footnotes this feature may be missed).</p>\n<p>Along a similar line, I think it would be useful to link the footnotes in the text to the footnotes on the bottom of the page. The hyperlinking of footnotes from citation to entry seems to be a fairly accepted convention at this point in electronic scholarly publishing. This works best when one can return to the original place in the text by hitting the browser's back button (i.e. rather than having this return to the top of the page and having to work your way down again). A pop-up window for footnotes is another potential solution. In this scenario the reader can simply exit out of the pop-up and continue reading.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"fe2687ff-2cce-5b31-af22-427f2b619bef"}},
