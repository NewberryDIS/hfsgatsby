As accessible as a vernacular textbook was, do you think there were still major economic hurdles that might have inhibited their commercial success? I can imagine large institutional buyers (or influencers) and the educated elite shunning the vernacular texts. I recently came across Edmund Reeve's \"An Introduction into the Greeke Tongue\" (London: NP, 1650), a early Greek grammar in English. The title page reads \"Composed for their sakes which understand not Latine; and yet are desirous to have some competent knowledge in the originall sacred scripture.\" One would think that a basic Greek grammar in English might have a ready audience, yet the book does not appear to have had much life beyond the first edition (a second issue including an an errata leaf was printed in 1657).</p>\n<p>Another work that comes to mind is Elizabeth Elstob's \"œRudiments of Grammar for the English-Saxon Tongue\" (London: Printed by W. Bowyer, 1715). The book is the first Anglo-Saxon grammar in English, and Elstob's preface speaks to why she wrote it: \"Considering the pleasure I myself had reaped from the knowledge I have gained from the original of our mother tongue, and that others of my own sex, might be capable of the same satisfaction: I resolv'd to give them the rudiments of that language in English dress.\" This beautifully printed book, with new Anglo-Saxon types created for the project, was a commercial flop. It was ignored in favor of other works (in Latin) in use at the time. Like Reeve's grammar, Elstob's book ended with the first edition.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3cfe0941-15cb-5e6d-a467-0d929db5fc8f"}},
