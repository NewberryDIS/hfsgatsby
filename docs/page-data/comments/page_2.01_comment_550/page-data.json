Most of the work has concentrated on the Trecento and early Quattrocento --the classic period for studies of humanism-- and there is as yet no consensus about the tranformations of the curriculum wrought by printing. A good basic summary of the results of this research appears in an essay by Robert Black in the Short Oxford History of Italy volume entitled <em>Italy in the Age of the Renaissance 1300-1550</em>, ed. John M. Najemy (Oxford University Press, 2004). For that same (pre-print), Latin educational world, see also the monographic issue of the University of Rome's \"Studi (e testi) italiani\" edited in 2006 by Emilio Russo and entitled, <em>Testimoni del vero. Su alcuni libri in biblioteche d'autore</em>. Of particular interest is the essay by Giuseppina Brunetti and Sonia Gentili, \"Una biblioteca nella Firenze di Dante,\" op. cit. pp. 21-55.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"27279d9b-4b91-5254-be4e-dc8cdf1300cc"}},
