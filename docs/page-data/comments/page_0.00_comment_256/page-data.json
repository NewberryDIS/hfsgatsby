I like having the images right with the text, and in such high quality that one can see a lot by enlarging them. How many printed books have plates that are remotely this informative or beautiful?</p>\n<p>Sometimes I lost the thread from section to section when reading chapters on-screen. When I printed out some chapters in toto and read them the old-fashioned way, on paper, the problem vanished. Perhaps I'm just not a good reader of computer screens (are our students better at it, I wonder?).</p>\n<p>Is there any way to make the footnote markers \"live\" so that one can click on them to gain access and return to the same place in the text? I ended up consulting far fewer of them as I read than I normally would do. Also, since the citations in the notes are overwhelmingly in short form, a live link to the bibliography would help immensely. Eventually I figured out I just needed to download the .pdf of the bibliography and keep it open on the side of the screen.</p>\n<p>Thanks, Paul, for putting your book online! This is a great resource to which I'll return again and again.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":null,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e04eb154-bcd7-5fb9-a512-3a1648ef52ee"}},
